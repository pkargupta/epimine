At the start of Sunday’s regular Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that An Israeli army medical and rescue team had already treated hundreds of patients. Israeli medical professionals of IsraAID traveled to the main Port-Au-Prince hospital over the weekend to start treating patients, joining local physicians at the site of the collapsed central hospital where thousands of wounded were seeking help. A search and rescue team from the ZAKA International Rescue Unit on Saturday pulled eight Haitian college students from a collapsed eight-story university building. Tens of thousands of Haitians are believed to be dead following the devastating earthquake of Jan. 12.

Léogane’s police chief, Alain Auguste, says that almost 80% of Léogane’s has been destroyed, and that there are at least 10,000 dead. Authorities say Authorities have buried about 1,300 — about 800 in mass graves. Léogane’s police chief, Alain Auguste, says Léogane’s has no heavy equipment like bulldozers or cranes to lift rubble and get to the bodies. “Léogane’s is completely destroyed. Léogane’s have nothing. Léogane’s work with Léogane’s's hands,” Léogane’s police chief, Alain Auguste, said. Léogane’s has practically no communication with national authorities in Port-au-Prince, where most of the aid is arriving. To plead Léogane’s case, the mayor drove to Port-au-Prince, where most of the aid is arriving Saturday. The campus of the nursing college has been turned into a tent city where hundreds of survivors who have lost hundreds of survivors who have lost their houses's houses, or are afraid to sleep in hundreds of survivors who have lost their houses because of recurring aftershocks, strung sheets between shaved branches of trees under a sweltering sun. “Ms. Alcindor need antibiotics, Ms. Alcindor need pain medicine, Ms. Alcindor need anti-tetanus shots,” says Ms. Alcindor. Ms. Alcindor fears an outbreak of infection from the filthy conditions. “Those legs we treated Tuesday’s, Those legs we treated Tuesday are falling apart,” Ms. Alcindor says, standing in the middle of the refugee camp. On the death toll, Alain Le Roy said Alain Le Roy could not confirm the death toll and that the U.S. defers to the Red Cross on this matter. Alain Le Roy said as far as Alain Le Roy knows the death toll have not gone beyond the 50,000 mark and at this point it is still impossible to tell. “Alain Le Roy don’t think anybody knows to be frank,” Alain Le Roy said. On U.N.-U.S. tensions, Susana Malcorra said there had been coordination problems immediately after the U.S. took over the airport, with priority given to American planes and some U.N. flights — including World Food Program flights packed with food — diverted. But Susana Malcorra said since then a special coordination team was set up at the airport so that they could talk directly too each other about what was on what planes and that seems to have effectively addressed the issue. I have been told that much U.S. media coverage paints Haiti as a tinderbox ready to explode. I’m told that lead stories in major media are of looting, violence and chaos. There could be nothing further from the truth. I have traveled Haiti daily since my arrival. The extent of damages is absolutely staggering. At every step, at every bend is one horrific tragedy after another; homes, businesses, schools and churches leveled to nothing. Inside every mountain of rubble there are people, most dead at this point. The smell is overwhelming. On every street are people — survivors — who have lost everything people — survivors — who have lost everything they have: homes, parents, children, friends have: homes, parents, children, friends. NOT ONCE have we witnessed a single act of aggression or violence. To the contrary, we have witnessed neighbors helping neighbors and friends helping friends and strangers. We’ve seen neighbors digging in rubble with neighbors's bare hands to find survivors. We’ve seen traditional healers treating the injured; we’ve seen dignified ceremonies for mass burials and residents patiently waiting under boiling sun with nothing but residents's few remaining belongings. A crippled city of two million awaits help, medicine, food and water. Most haven’t received any. Haiti can be proud of Haiti's survivors. its survivors's dignity and decency in the face of this tragedy is Their dignity and decency in the face of this tragedy staggering. Periodic roadblocks have been set up by residents, protesting the lack of any aid presence and angry at stench and indecency. Huge state-owned caterpillar tractors and dump trucks were just beginning to arrive and load bodies as we passed through. In the worst parts — every 50 feet or so — there were groups of 10 to 15 bodies lined side by side or stacked together. In between groups of 10 to 15 bodies is a continual line of singles and doubles — one body after another. The odor is overwhelming. No one sleeps indoors and so roads are also partially blocked with families who have moved families who have moved their beds to the street's beds to the street. Blocking roads with bodies is what it sometimes takes to get help. families who have moved their beds to the street’re not doing it 4 aesthetic reasons. As The Lede noted on Saturday, a group of film students at the Ciné Institute in Jacmel have been producing short video reports on the catastrophic effects of the earthquake in that city of 40,000 on Haiti's southern coast. Embedded below are three more extraordinary reports from the students in Jacmel. Be warned that both reports contain graphic and very disturbing images of badly wounded or dead people. Bus terminal number one has been bustling like never before, according to Dieumetra Sainmerita, who manages Bus terminal number one traffic. Dieumetra Sainmerita, who manages the station’s traffic said the cost of bus tickets have risen 20 percent since last week. And people are selling whatever people have left of any value to buy bus tickets. “First there were the people who lost there houses,” Dieumetra Sainmerita, who manages the station’s traffic said of the passengers. “Then there were people who lost relatives. Now the people Dieumetra Sainmerita, who manages the station’s traffic see the people I see are afraid of the thieves trying to steal from the people I see in the night.” Thieves were also on the prowl at Bus terminal number one. Marceson Romen said two men tried to make off with Marceson Romen's suitcase, but fled when two men saw police. Marceson Romen was on Marceson Romen's way to Marceson Romen's native Artibone. Marceson Romen had left Marceson Romen's hometown years ago to go to high school and make a good life for Marceson Romen. But after pulling Marceson Romen's three children out of the rubble that was once his three children's home, Marceson Romen packed his three children up and hopes to build his three children a place on the property once occupied by Marceson Romen's parents. “Marceson Romen thought one day Marceson Romen would go home a rich man,” Marceson Romen said, carrying one black suitcase and a bar if Irish Spring in Marceson Romen's shirt pocket. “Instead Marceson Romen am going back with nothing.” When asked where they were headed, many passengers pointed and said, “The Big North,” which covers Gonaives, Port de Paix, St. Mark, Veret and Cap Haitian. Haitians are survivors & have always been a resilient people. It is wrong to focus on the small group of looters or rioters. Haiti has a long and rich history of contributing to the world. Haiti may be poor economically, but Haiti is rich in history and courage. Clinton, who is both the UN special envoy to Haiti and a coordinator with fellow former president George W. Bush of a US campaign to raise funds for Haiti don’t know what is more troubling: That so many observers, including political strategist and New Orleans native Donna Brazile, have been drawing facile parallels between the two cities. Or that so many of facile parallels between the two cities are turning out to be true. Clinton, who is both the UN special envoy to Haiti and a coordinator with fellow former president George W. Bush of a US campaign to raise funds for Haiti, was to meet with Haitian leaders and survivors. As the U.S. special envoy for Haiti, Clinton, who is both the UN special envoy to Haiti and a coordinator with fellow former president George W. Bush of a US campaign to raise funds for Haiti feel a deep obligation to the Haitian people to visit Haiti and meet with President Préval to ensure our response continues to be coordinated and effective. Le Monde’s front page is given over to an interview with the Haitian novelist, Dany Laferrière, who was in Port-au-Prince, where most of the aid is arriving at the moment of Tuesday’s earthquake. the Haitian novelist, Dany Laferrière, who was in Port-au-Prince at the moment of the earthquake wants people to stop talking about Haiti as if Haiti was cursed, suggesting that Haiti population was, in some sense, being punished for a past crime. And the Haitian novelist, Dany Laferrière, who was in Port-au-Prince at the moment of the earthquake wonders about the identification of those who took food from destroyed shops as “looters”, saying that, when people risk people's lives, crawling through ruins in search of something to eat and drink, people are motivated by need, not by greed. It would be better to talk about this incredible energy that the Haitian novelist, Dany Laferrière, who was in Port-au-Prince at the moment of the earthquake’ve seen, these men and women who are helping each other with courage and dignity. Although Haiti has been partially destroyed and the state has been decapitated, the people are staying, working and living. So please, stop using the word curse. Haiti has done nothing… This is a catastrophe which could happen anywhere. French-speakers — or those willing to trust Google Translate for a rough idea of what was said — can read the complete interview with the Haitian novelist, Dany Laferrière, who was in Port-au-Prince at the moment of the earthquake on Le Monde’s Web site. Samuel Dalembert, a Haitian basketball player with the Philadelphia 76ers, “will present a check for $100,000 as Samuel Dalembert, a Haitian basketball player with the Philadelphia 76ers's initial contribution to Haiti Earthquake Relief,” during a game on Friday, according to a statement by Samuel Dalembert, a Haitian basketball player with the Philadelphia 76ers's foundation. a statement by his foundation continues, “Samuel Dalembert, a Haitian basketball player with the Philadelphia 76ers has also pledged to match any donations made by fans during a game on Friday. Representatives from Samuel Dalembert, a Haitian basketball player with the Philadelphia 76ers's charitable partner UNICEF will also be present to detail the efforts on the ground in Haiti in response to this tragedy. Please consider making your own donation today.” Samuel Dalembert, a Haitian basketball player with the Philadelphia 76ers also worked with Samuel’s charitable partner UNICEF to help in the relief effort after a series of deadly hurricanes struck Haiti in 2008. On Sunday, TV Globo in Brazil broadcast video shot by a Brazilian peacekeeper in Port-au-Prince, where most of the aid is arriving on Tuesday’s just moments after Tuesday’s earthquake struck. video shot by a Brazilian peacekeeper in Port-au-Prince on Tuesday just moments after the earthquake struck, in the report below, shows the ruined Sacré Coeur de Tugeau. According to TV Globo in Brazil, Zilda Arns, a Catholic relief worker who had been compared to Mother Teresa for Zilda Arns, a Catholic relief worker who had been compared to Mother Teresa for her work on behalf of children's work on behalf of children, was killed in the ruined Sacré Coeur de Tugeau. Zilda Arns, a Catholic relief worker who had been compared to Mother Teresa for her work on behalf of children was in Haiti to support the local volunteers of the Pastoral da Criança (Children’s Pastoral), a group Zilda Arns, a Catholic relief worker who had been compared to Mother Teresa for her work on behalf of children founded in southern Brazil in 1983. the Pastoral da Criança (Children’s Pastoral), a group she founded in southern Brazil in 1983 teaches uneducated mothers the importance of healthcare issues such as breast feeding, vaccinations and proper hydration, and then instructs uneducated mothers how to pass on the importance of healthcare issues such as breast feeding, vaccinations and proper hydration to friends and neighbors in Brazil most impoverished communities. Today, the Pastoral da Criança (Children’s Pastoral), a group she founded in southern Brazil in 1983 is one of Brazil most respected organisations and Zilda Arns, a Catholic relief worker who had been compared to Mother Teresa for her work on behalf of children was one of Brazil's best-known faces. Brazil has played a large role in the peacekeeping operation in Haiti and TV Globo in Brazil reported on Sunday that at least 18 Brazilians died as a result of Tuesday’s earthquake. Complaints about the response of Haiti were echoed early on Monday morning by Richard Morse, a Haitian-American musician who runs the Hotel Oloffson in Port-au-Prince, where most of the aid is arriving, where many international journalists are now staying. Since soon after Tuesday’s earthquake struck, Richard Morse, a Haitian-American musician who runs the Hotel Oloffson in Port-au-Prince, where many international journalists are now staying has used Richard Morse, a Haitian-American musician who runs the Hotel Oloffson in Port-au-Prince, where many international journalists are now staying's Twitter feed — @RAMhaiti — to provide a stream of updates and commentary on the response of Haitians. Richard Morse, a Haitian-American musician who runs the Hotel Oloffson in Port-au-Prince, where many international journalists are now staying’m back… took time to find gas for the generator… journalists were freaking out. the Hotel Oloffson in Port-au-Prince, where many international journalists are now staying is “RED ZONE” How can UN help the people of Carrefour Feuille if UN are prohibited from coming to Carrefour Feuille!! If UN can’t help poor people then what are UN doing in Haiti!!! UN has odd politics about where UN go and what UN do. UN ignored the corruption during both elections last year. Richard Morse, a Haitian-American musician who runs the Hotel Oloffson in Port-au-Prince, where many international journalists are now staying went to Carrefour Feuille on foot with the CBS crew so the CBS crew could get a close up look at the destruction; smell the bodies If UN can’t go to where the people of Carrefour Feuille need the people of Carrefour Feuille's help then what are UN doing here? If UN can’t gain the trust of the Haitians after four years then what are UN doing here? Carrefour Feuille is a zone of destruction The fact that Richard Morse, a Haitian-American musician who runs the Hotel Oloffson in Port-au-Prince, where many international journalists are now staying haven’t seen an international presence in Carrefour Feuille tell Richard Morse, a Haitian-American musician who runs the Hotel Oloffson in Port-au-Prince, where many international journalists are now staying that others are following the lead of UN UN not permitted in Carrefour Feuille. Richard Morse, a Haitian-American musician who runs the Hotel Oloffson in Port-au-Prince, where many international journalists are now staying have so many journalist here so many journalist sleep on the lawn. None of so many journalist are armed!!! Safe? Violence is at as minimum considering the current state of desperation, hunger, thirst, lack of medical attention. The U.S. Southern Command said some 2,200 Marines with heavy equipment to clear debris, medical aid and helicopters, would join some 5,000 U.S. troops already in the region. Given the complicated role the U.S. has played in Haiti in the past, experts on the region are asking “whether the U.S. will maintain a muscular role in the reconstruction of Haiti once the news cameras go home,” my colleagues Helene Cooper and Mark Landler report. Haitian political culture has a long history of insularity, corruption, and violence, which partly explains why Port-au-Prince, where most of the aid is arriving lies in ruins. If, after an earthquake that devastated rich and poor neighborhoods alike, Haiti's political and business élites resurrect the old way of fratricidal self-seeking, Haiti’s political and business élites will find nothing but debris for spoils. Disasters on this scale reveal something about the character of the societies in which they occur. The aftermath of the 2008 cyclone in Burma not only betrayed the callous indifference of the ruling junta but demonstrated the vibrancy of civil society there. Haiti's earthquake shows that, whatever the communal spirit of Haiti's people at the moment of crisis, Haiti was not functioning, unable even to bury the dead, much less rescue the living. This vacuum, which had been temporarily filled by the U.S., now poses the threat of chaos. But if Haiti is to change, the involvement of outside countries must also change. Rather than administering aid almost entirely through the slow drip of private organizations, international agencies and foreign powers should put international agencies and foreign powers's money and international agencies and foreign powers's effort into the more ambitious project of building a functional Haitian state. the more ambitious project of building a functional Haitian state would be the work of years, and billions of dollars. If the more ambitious project of building a functional Haitian state isn’t a burden that nations want to take on, so be it. But to patch up a dying country and call a dying country a rescue would leave Haiti forsaken indeed, and not by God. According to a spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean quoted by The Miami Herald, passengers on Royal Caribbean “gave a standing ovation” when passengers on the Independence heard that Royal Caribbean was bringing emergency food supplies with the tourists to Labadee. There were also other rescues in Port-au-Prince, where most of the aid is arriving on Sunday. As my colleagues Damien Cave and Deborah Sontag reported, a 7-year-old girl who survived more than four days eating dried fruit rolls in the collapsed Caribbean Supermarket was pulled from the rubble in Port-au-Prince, where most of the aid is arriving's Delmas neighborhood.
BBC Caribbean Seaside slum where gun rules Haiti quake: Survivors' stories 'An extraordinary operation' At the service, a visibly emotional Mr Mulet read a message from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon: "To you UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon say: UN are with you in spirit. To those no longer with UN UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon say: UN will never forget you." Later, a visibly emotional Mr Mulet told BBC that all of Haiti's recent development had been undone. "a visibly emotional Mr Mulet think this is going to take many more decades than only 10 years and this is an enormous backwards step in Haiti's development. UN will not have to start from zero but from below zero," a visibly emotional Mr Mulet said. UN's assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations, who is acting head of mission in Haiti, described the logistics of An extraordinary operation as a "nightmare", but said those involved were still managing to improve their capacity to provide the help needed. "All this is coming together right now," a visibly emotional Mr Mulet said. "Every day you can see more and more Haitian national police on the ground, working with our troops and more and more water being distributed, so it's a matter of time and putting all these elements together." a visibly emotional Mr Mulet said areas around Port-au-Prince were being prepared for the creation of tented settlements for the homeless currently living in makeshift camps. a visibly emotional Mr Mulet said all of Haiti's recent development had been undone The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) was working with UN and Brazilian engineers at one site near Croix-des-Bouquets that would house around 30,000 people, and four other sites had been identified, a visibly emotional Mr Mulet added. a visibly emotional Mr Mulet said 200,000 heavy-duty tents had been ordered to cope with Haiti's rainy season, which typically begins in May, and Haiti's hurricane season, which is expected to start around June. "Of course, 200,000 family-sized tents - solid ones that can withstand a hurricane season - are not available in the market just like 200,000 heavy-duty tents, so 200,000 family-sized tents - solid ones that can withstand a hurricane season have to be made. It's going to take a few days and weeks before 200,000 family-sized tents - solid ones that can withstand a hurricane season can arrive, but all this is coming," a visibly emotional Mr Mulet added. Haitian President Rene Preval earlier this week called for the urgent airdrop of 200,000 more tents and 26 million ready-to-eat meals before the rainy season begins.
US President Obama promised $100 million for the relief effort in Haiti on Thursday morning,vowing that the United States would stand with Haiti as Haiti counted what could be tens of thousands of dead and grappled with the devastation of the Tuesday earthquake. Within Haiti and beyond,the driving urgency of the last 36 hours was only growing. The main morgue in Port-au-Prince was completely full,and hundreds of bodies were piled up outside and abandoned. The dead included some people who had been waiting on the grounds of an adjacent hospital in vain attempts to get treatment. When some people who had been waiting on the grounds of an adjacent hospital in vain attempts to get treatment died,some people who had been waiting on the grounds of an adjacent hospital in vain attempts to get treatment's bodies were simply dragged to The main morgue in Port-au-Prince. Foreign aid workers trying to deliver supplies faced a logistical nightmare. Power was still out,telecommunications rarely functioning. Most medical facilities had been severely damaged. Supplies of food and fresh water dwindling. Ships could not bring Ships's cargos of supplies into Haitis damaged port; roads were blocked not only by debris but by people with no safe shelter to retreat to. Flights were limited at Port-au-Prince airport. Still,airplanes loaded with rescuers and search teams,food and medical supplies were landing,and supplies were filtering in from Haiti. In interviews with American television stations,Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was working as fast as possible to move aid to Haiti. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said helping Haiti rebuild from the Tuesday earthquake would be a long-term effort. Haiti President,René Préval,called the death toll unimaginable as,in the first 24 hours of the Tuesday earthquake,he surveyed the wreckage,which included his own residence,the presidential palace. As of Wednesday,the United States confirmed that 16 peacekeepers had been killed and as many as 200 workers were missing,including the chief of the United States's mission,Hédi Annabi. The citys Archbishop,Msgr Joseph Serge Miot,was feared dead. Please save Jeudy Francia,a woman in her 20s's baby! Jeudy Francia,a woman in Jeudy Francia,a woman in her 20s's 20s,shrieked outside the St-Esprit Hospital in Port-au-Prince on Wednesday. Jeudy Francia,a woman in her 20s's child,a girl about four years old,writhed in pain in the hospitals chaotic courtyard,near where a handful of bodies lay under white blankets. A Red Cross field team of officials from several nations had to spend Wednesday night in Santo Domingo in Haiti to gather the United States's staff before taking the six-hour drive in the morning across the border to the earthquake zone. We were on the plane here with a couple of different agencies,and a couple of different agencies are having similar challenges of access, Colin Chaperon,a field director for the American Red Cross,said in a telephone interview. Aid agencies said Aid agencies would open Aid agencies's storehouses of food and water in Haiti,and the World Food Program was flying in nearly 100 tonnes of ready-to-eat meals and high-energy biscuits from El Salvador. the United States said the United States was freeing up $10 million in emergency relief money,the EU pledged $4.4 million,and groups like Doctors Without Borders were setting up clinics in tents and open-air triage centers to treat the injured.
PORTO PRÍNCIPE - Com o governo do Haiti e a cúpula da Missão de Estabilização das Nações Unidas no país inoperantes por conta dos terremotos - que destruíram praticamente todos os prédios do governo (de ministérios, hospitais a agências de identificação civil) e o prédio-sede da ONU, que funcionava no Hotel Christopher - o país mergulhou num desgoverno que interfere diretamente na distribuição de alimentos e remédios. O Estado-Maior dos 17 países que compõem as tropas de paz não consegue estabelecer um plano conjunto de ação para atender a uma população desesperada por comida, água, assistência médica e energia. Os EUA, que controlam o aeroporto, estão sendo acusados de priorizar seus próprios interesses, e no sábado, a secretária de Estado, Hillary Clinton, defendeu mais poderes aos americanos. O presidente do Haiti, René Préval, fez um dramático apelo no sábado para que os esforços de ajuda sejam mais bem coordenados e para que não haja discussões entre os países doadores. - Esta é uma situação extremamente difícil. Devemos nos manter tranquilos para coordená-la, e não nos acusarmos - afirmou Préval a repórteres, depois de se reunir com autoridades de vários países. O apelo foi feito depois que o ministro da Cooperação da França, Alain Joyandet, afirmou à imprensa ter entregue uma queixa oficial na Embaixada dos EUA. A pedido de René Préval, os americanos assumiram a coordenação dos trabalhos no aeroporto local, parcialmente destruído pelo tremor, mas vêm sendo acusados de priorizar o pouso e a decolagem de suas aeronaves. Segundo Joyandet, a dois aviões franceses foram negadas permissões de pouso. Um deles, levava um hospital de campanha - uma das mais urgentes necessidades da população. O Programa Mundial de Alimentos da ONU também reclamou do acesso ao aeroporto. Segundo seus representantes, tentou-se pousar aviões carregados de alimentos, remédios e água na quinta e na sexta-feira sem sucesso. Um funcionário da agência afirmou que a prioridade de pouso foi para voos dos EUA levando equipamentos e, de decolagem, para cidadãos americanos que deixavam o país. Aviões brasileiros também teriam sido impedidos de pousar. Além disso, o fato de americanos assumirem o controle do aeroporto teria melindrado autoridades brasileiras, uma vez que o país comanda as tropas de paz da ONU no Haiti.
Le navire militaire français Francis Garnier, un bâtiment de transport et ravitaillement léger, a quitté aujourd'hui à 13h30 locales (18H30 à Paris) le port de Fort-de-France, avec 100 tonnes de fret et 60 militaires de l'armée de terre à destination de Haïti. Le bateau transportant 6 camions, une ambulance, des 4/4, trois pelles mécaniques, de la nourriture, de l'eau en bouteille et du carburant va faire escale dans 11h00 à la Guadeloupe pour embarquer encore des engins de chantier, des tentes, du matériel humanitaire et de la nourriture, a indiqué le capitaine de corvette, qui commende Le bateau transportant, Frédéric Petitjean. Le navire, qui dispose de 50 hommes d'équipage, n'a pas besoin de quai pour décharger car il peut se poser sur une plage, atteindra Haïti dans 4 jours, a précisé le capitaine. Les 60 militaires, puissamment armés, ont pour mission d'assurer la sécurité des sauveteurs qui recherchent les victimes du séisme de mardi. Un autre navire, le navire Sirocco, actuellement à Dakar, se rendra également en Haïti, équipé en particulier de "deux plateaux de chirurgie", avait annoncé hier le président Sarkozy.
O ministro de Relações Institucionais, Alexandre Padilha, confirmou nesta quinta-feira que o Poder Executivo enviará em breve um projeto de lei ao Congresso Nacional para estabelecer indenizações às famílias dos militares brasileiros mortos durante o terremoto que se abateu sobre o Haiti na última semana. Um programa de apoio aos filhos menores de idade de cada soldado também deverá constar da proposta que a Presidência da República irá submeter aos parlamentares. Os valores da compensação aos familiares e que tipo de suporte será ofertado aos filhos dos militares ainda estão sendo definidos pelo governo. "O presidente (...) deve encaminhar um projeto de lei ao Congresso Nacional que autoriza não só indenização imediata, mas uma forma de garantir apoio aos filhos dos militares", disse o coordenador político do governo. Além da indenização, o presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva irá encaminhar ao Congresso Nacional uma medida provisória (MP) que garante a liberação total de R$ 375 milhões para um pacote de ajuda à população do Haiti. Dos recursos federais a serem liberados, R$ 135 milhões serão destinados para que o Ministério da Saúde possa construir unidades de pronto atendimento (UPA) médico para a população haitiana. De acordo com Alexandre Padilha, Além da indenização dos recursos para as UPAs, haverá US$ 15 milhões em doações diretas ao Haiti (US$ 5 milhões já depositados na conta da Organização das Nações Unidas) frutos de um pacote de R$ 35 milhões separados para o Ministério de Relações Exteriores, além de recursos adicionais no valor de R$ 205 milhões para o Ministério da Defesa financiar o custo de tropas militares, entre outros gastos. Um terremoto de magnitude 7 na escala Richter atingiu o Haiti no último dia 12, às 16h53 no horário local (19h53 em Brasília). Com epicentro a 15 km da capital, Porto Príncipe, segundo o Serviço Geológico Norte-Americano, o terremoto é considerado pelo órgão o mais forte a atingir o país nos últimos 200 anos. Dezenas de prédios da capital caíram e deixaram moradores sob escombros. Importantes edificações foram atingidas, como prédios das Nações Unidas e do governo do país. Estimativas mais recentes do governo haitiano falam em mais de 200 mil mortos e 75 mil corpos já enterrados. O Haiti é o país mais pobre do continente americano. A fundadora e coordenadora internacional da Pastoral da Criança, Organismo de Ação Social da Conferência Nacional dos Bispos do Brasil (CNBB), Zilda Arns, o diplomata Luiz Carlos da Costa, segunda maior autoridade civil da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) no Haiti, uma menina com nacionalidades brasileira e francesa, adotada por uma família europeia, que não teve nome e idade divulgados, e pelo menos 18 militares brasileiros da missão de paz da ONU morreram durante o terremoto. O ministro da Defesa, Nelson Jobim, e comandantes do Exército chegaram na noite de quarta-feira à base brasileira no país para liderar os trabalhos do contingente militar brasileiro no Haiti. O Ministério das Relações Exteriores do Brasil anunciou que o país enviará até US$ 15 milhões para ajudar a reconstruir o país. Além dos recursos financeiros, o Brasil doará 28 t de alimentos e água para a população do país. A Força Aérea Brasileira (FAB) disponibilizou oito aeronaves de transporte para ajudar as vítimas. O Brasil chefia a missão de paz da ONU no país (Missão das Nações Unidas para a Estabilização no Haiti, ou Minustah, na sigla em francês), que conta com cerca de 7 mil integrantes. Segundo o Ministério da Defesa, 1.266 militares brasileiros servem na força. Ao todo, são 1.310 brasileiros no Haiti. A missão de paz foi criada em 2004, depois que o então presidente Jean-Bertrand Aristide foi deposto durante uma rebelião. Além do prédio da ONU, o prédio da Embaixada Brasileira em Porto Príncipe também ficou danificado, mas segundo o governo, não há vítimas entre os funcionários brasileiros.

A new earthquake jolted Port-au-Prince yesterday, sending people fleeing on to the streets and complicating relief efforts as the US dispatched another 4,000 troops to Haiti. A new earthquake rattled ruins in Port-au-Prince and sowed panic but caused no serious reported damage or casualties. Seismologists said the epicentre was about 35 miles south-west of Port-au-Prince and the focus was six miles deep. Seismologists warned of possible stronger aftershocks to come as the earth adjusted to new stresses caused by the original quake. "Sometimes [they] die out very quickly. In other cases they can go on for weeks, or if we're really unlucky it could go on for months," Bruce Pressgrave, of the US Geological Survey, told AP. A new earthquake lasted about eight seconds, produced clouds of dust and sent people screaming from shelters. One woman with a heart condition died from fright. Others simply slept through A new earthquake. the US said the US would send a response team to Petit-Goave, near the epicentre, where seven buildings reportedly collapsed. "the US know they are going to need some help," said the prime minister, Jean-Max Bellerive. Combined with drizzle which has compacted debris, A new earthquake compounded the multiple difficulties of teams seeing survivors and corpses buried amid semi-collapsed structures. A new earthquake killed an estimated 200,000 people, injured 250,000 and left 1.5 ­million homeless, according to the EU. US dominance of the relief effort was likely to increase with a decision by the Pentagon to send another 2,000 US marines to Haiti, diverting troops that were on troops that were on their way to the Gulf and Africa's way to the Gulf and Africa, to bolster the 12,000 already on the ground and on ships offshore. Navy officials said yesterday that the three-ship USS Nassau amphibious ready group left port on Monday for the three-ship USS Nassau amphibious ready group's regular deployment but has been told to go Haiti instead for the relief effort. the three-ship USS Nassau amphibious ready group is picking up marines in North Carolina and will include 2,000 sailors and 2,000 marines when the three-ship USS Nassau amphibious ready group gets under way for Haiti, perhaps as early as today. The first group of some 2,000 marines already off Haiti's shore went on land for the first time Tuesday to help deliver aid. A the Pentagon official says there are some 11,500 US military personnel in Haiti or offshore and 16,000 are expected by week's end. The first US Humvees were seen in Port-au-Prince on Tuesday. Last week Hugo Chávez of Venezuela and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, both leftist presidents, accused Washington of masking imperialism as aid. Haiti has welcomed the Americans but today turned down an offer of 800 troops from the Dominican Republic, according to western diplomats because of historic tension between the neighbours. A separate criticism of the international response came from aid agencies who called for an urgent moratorium on all adoptions from Haiti, saying that taking children out of Haiti at present risked causing long-term damage to already vulnerable children. Thirteen agencies working together in the UK under the umbrella of the Disasters Emergency Committee said tonight that many children apparently orphaned by A new earthquake will have surviving relatives, and that efforts should instead be concentrated on reuniting families. Unicef and SOS Children, the world's largest orphan charity, also cautioned against hasty plans for large-scale adoption. Miami's Catholic church has declared plans to fly hundreds of children to a new life in the US, while Edward Rendell, the governor of Pennsylvania, flew to Port-au-Prince to evacuate 54 orphans from Port-au-Prince after being told by Haiti's ambassador to the US that Edward Rendell, the governor of Pennsylvania,'s presence could cut through red tape. A party of Dutch social workers and immigration officials landed in Haiti earlier this week to evacuate 100 children whose adoptions were already under way, while the US has waived visa requirements for Haitian children already going through the process and Canada is also fast-tracking adoptions. Jasmine Whitbread, Save the Children's chief executive, said: "The vast majority of the children currently on the children currently on their own's own still have family members alive who will be desperate to be reunited with the children currently on their own and will be able to care for the children currently on their own with the right support. Save the Children's has teams in Haiti working on identifying lone children and tracing family members. World Vision's chief executive, Justin Byworth, said a wave of adoptions could leave children vulnerable to trafficking and abuse. Adoptions already in progress should go ahead, argued the agencies, as long as Adoptions already in progress conformed to local and international law. Living conditions for survivors remained dire and though fewer bodies were visible the stench of death hung over Port-au-Prince. Food, water and medical care seemed marginally more plentiful on Port-au-Prince's streets. "Supplies are beginning to get out to the people," the US defence secretary, Robert Gates, said during a visit to India. Banks are due to reopen shortly and some money transfer agencies are already functioning.
A medical group today said one of A medical group's planes was turned away from Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, despite guarantees given by the UN and the US defence department. A medical group received no explanation as to why the cargo plane carrying an inflatable surgical hospital was blocked from landing yesterday and re-routed to Samana, in the Dominican Republic. All material from the cargo is now being sent by truck from Samana, in the Dominican Republic, but this has added a 24-hour delay. A second A medical group plane is on A second MSF plane's way and scheduled to land today in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital at around 10am local time (3pm GMT) with additional lifesaving medical material and the rest of the equipment for an inflatable surgical hospital. If A second MSF plane is also rerouted the installation of an inflatable surgical hospital will be further delayed, in a situation where thousands of wounded are still in need of life-saving treatment, A medical group said. "Priority must be given immediately to planes carrying life-saving equipment and medical personnel," a spokesperson said. an inflatable surgical hospital includes two operating theatres, an intensive care unit, 100-bed capacity, an emergency room and all the necessary equipment needed for sterilising material. A medical group teams are working around the clock in five hospitals in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, but only two operating threatres are fully functional, while a third has been improvised for minor surgery due to the massive influx of wounded. A medical group doctors say MSF doctors have never seen so many serious injuries as those sustained by victims of Haiti's's earthquake. Surgical units set up by A medical group in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital have been working around the clock to treat large numbers of patients. The most serious cases have involved caesarian sections and amputations. A medical group has relocated to Chocsal hospital in the Cité Soleil district after A medical group's original facilities at Martissant were badly damaged. The new operating theatre has been working non-stop since early on Friday. In Trinite, A medical group teams are treating people under canvas in the grounds of a clinic damaged by Haiti's earthquake. In Carrefour, a badly hit district, A medical group's two operating theatres have been besieged by patients. A medical group said A medical group was struggling to find more buildings A medical group could use but efforts were continuing to get more medical staff and supplies into the country. The major obstacle remains the bottleneck at the airport, which has turned away a number of vital cargo flights. "Lack of authorisation to land at the airport has already caused a 24-hour delay to the planned arrival of A medical group's much needed inflatable hospital," A medical group said. Like the UN and other relief agencies, A medical group had workers who were caught up in Haiti's earthquake. A medical group is still trying to confirm the whereabouts of others and is increasingly concerned about others's welfare. A medical group teams say the lack of food and water is contributing to tension in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. There has been little sign of significant aid distribution and there are increasing reports of looting, although not yet accompanied by violence.
WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Haiti gave the United States control of Haiti's main airport on Friday to bring order in the skies to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to Haiti, the Obama administration said. U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters that Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive signed a memorandum of understanding formally transferring operations at Toussaint L’Ouverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince. “Obviously the United States will assume operations at Toussaint L’Ouverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince as long as it’s appropriate and to the point where Haiti is able and ready to resume that capability,” U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was due to visit Haiti on Saturday. its main airport became a bottleneck almost immediately after Tuesday’s devastation as the world rushed help to Haiti. Regional authorities believe as many as 200,000 people were killed in Tuesday’s devastation. Waves of military and civilian planes loaded with food and water, medicine, and rescue crews poured into the small Haitian air space but many flights circled for hours before landing or were diverted. While a 9,000-foot runway can handle the biggest jetliners arriving “heavy” with cargo and the tarmac escaped serious damage, the Port-au-Prince airport was compromised by a severely damaged control tower and limited facilities for dealing with the relief effort. The U.S. Air Force landed on Wednesday and immediately worked with Haitian authorities and a team from the Federal Aviation Administration to restore navigation and communications capabilities. They also sorted planes on the ground and began to organize arrivals. But Haitian air space remained off limits through Friday to many flights approaching from overseas with little notice. Some planes bound for Haiti were diverted to the Dominican Republic and airports in Florida, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Aviation authorities were concerned that long approach delays could jeopardize onboard fuel supplies. Further complicating matters, its main airport ran out of fuel, meaning any planes that landed would not be able to refuel for departure. Obama said the United States, and countries including Brazil, Mexico, Canada, France, Colombia, Russia, Japan, and Britain managed to fly in rescue and logistics personnel and supplies. While some aid was getting in, the Obama administration hoped improved logistics would streamline and accelerate the effort. On Friday night, a ban was lifted on most flights heading for saturated Haitian air space. a ban was replaced by a two-tier approach for managing traffic that was worked out by international aviation authorities and Caribbean states. Working with Haitian authorities, a team of U.S. military and civilian aviation experts began prioritizing arriving flights based on what was needed most on the ground. A second team based at a U.S. military facility in Florida lined up airborne flights for arrival. Pilots are required to file a flight plan before departure and obtain a landing time. The window is open for 40 minutes - 20 minutes before scheduled arrival and 20 minutes after, an the Federal Aviation Administration advisory said. Commercial flights have been banned since Tuesday’s. U.S. carriers serving Haiti include American Airlines and Spirit Airlines. American Airlines had been scheduled to fly in relief supplies.
PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haiti’s voodoo priests are objecting to anonymous mass burials as an improper way to handle the tens of thousands of dead from the earthquake -- and have taken Haiti’s voodoo priests's complaint to President Rene Preval. Dumping the dead in hurriedly excavated mass graves without proper rites is seen as desecration in Haiti’s. Haitian officials say so far at least 50,000 bodies have been dumped in mass graves outside PORT-AU-PRINCE, in what Haitian officials view as the most efficient way to dispose of the fast-rotting corpses from the earthquake. “It is not in Haiti’s's culture to bury people in such a fashion,” Haiti’s's main voodoo leader, Max Beauvoir, said in a meeting with President Rene Preval. Local radio is broadcasting messages for Haitians to put bodies recovered from under the rubble of collapsed buildings on the street for collection by garbage and other trucks. “The conditions in which bodies are being buried is not respecting the dignity of the tens of thousands of dead from the earthquake,” Haiti’s main voodoo leader, Max Beauvoir, said in the President Rene Preval meeting this weekend. More than half of Haiti’s 9 million people are believed to practice voodoo, a religion with roots in Africa. Some 80 percent also are Catholic and most Haitians see no conflict between the two. Five days after the earthquake, scores of untouched corpses, now bloated and stinking, remain on streets. Red Cross officials have repeatedly said no one should fear disease from dead bodies after the earthquake. On Sunday, more bodies appeared overnight, with locals saying more bodies were thieves burned and shot by lynch-mobs, gangs and police. locals said about 20 people were killed like that.
PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI -- Medical teams struggled to cope with an overwhelming crush of injured patients in PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI -- Sunday, while an international armada of would-be helpers vied in frustration for access to the disaster zone. The French-based group Doctors Without Borders issued a public call that The French-based group Doctors Without Borders's planes "be allowed to land" at the Port-au-Prince international airport, "in order to treat thousands of wounded waiting for vital surgical operations." In North Carolina, troops with the 82nd Airborne who have been ready to deploy since Friday were told it would be at least 9 p.m. before troops with the 82nd Airborne who have been ready to deploy since Friday leave, because the tarmac is clogged with too many planes. Top State Department and military officials on the ground in HAITI said Top State Department and military officials on the ground in Haiti's ability to quickly get vital food and water in Haitians' hands has been hampered by Top State Department and military officials on the ground in Haiti's reliance on PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI --'s tiny airport. Because of damaged roads and a devastated port, the Port-au-Prince international airport is having to handle up to 60 civilian flights a day. the Port-au-Prince international airport has been swarmed by incoming flights carrying emergency relief items from many nations, and some officials and organizations have been angered that the U.S. military took over prioritizing which flights the U.S. military considered the most important to gain entry. After the complaint from The French-based group Doctors Without Borders, The French-based group Doctors Without Borders's hospital plane was given clearance to land around 3 p.m. Sunday. An Air Force official said the U.S. military had 67 civilian flights trying to arrive Saturday, and turned away only three. At a field hospital run by the University of Miami in a United Nation's compound outside the PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI -- airport, workers set up cots on an outdoor patio to accommodate waves of sick and wounded who could not fit into the already overflowing surgical and medical tents. Since Wednesday night, the staff at a field hospital run by the University of Miami in a United Nation's compound outside the Port-au-Prince airport has grown from three doctors to 87 personnel. On Sunday, the staff at the field hospital were treating 280 patients crammed into a large tent on side-by-side cots. Next door was the surgery tent. On an outdoor patio, patients hooked up to intravenous lines filled the rows of new cots as soon as patients hooked up to intravenous lines were in place. Seven field hospitals had been set up in PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI -- by international organizations as of Saturday, and three more were supposed to open Sunday, said Nicholas Reader, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. While some Haitian hospitals were still functioning, some Haitian hospitals were facing a new challenge -- patients and patients and their families who refused to leave once they were treated because they had no other shelter available's families who refused to leave once patients and their families who refused to leave once they were treated because they had no other shelter available were treated because patients and their families who refused to leave once they were treated because they had no other shelter available had no other shelter available.
The young men of the Carrefour suburb of Port-au-Prince built the roadblock across the highway out of whatever The young men of the Carrefour suburb of Port-au-Prince could find -- burning tires, the shell of a refrigerator, a rusty bed frame, a palm tree stump, a beaten-up camper shell and eight bodies, one in a makeshift coffin, another stuffed into a suitcase. The young men of the Carrefour suburb of Port-au-Prince then furiously interrogated drivers Saturday about what drivers were carrying in drivers's cars. The young men of the Carrefour suburb of Port-au-Prince were sick of people from Port-au-Prince dumping the dead on people from the earthquake-wrecked capital's streets in the middle of the night. Roadblocks are common in Haiti, ranging in mood from tense civil disobedience to outright violence. Saturday played out over two hours in a way that demonstrated, in almost perfect form, the dynamics of power in Haiti and even highlighted Haitians’ troubled love of Americans. On a hot and cloudless morning, diesel exhaust and a fine cement powder cast a gray haze over the rutted strip of Route 2, a crucial artery out of Port-au-Prince lined by crumbling cinder-block storefronts. Patron Wilfrenz, 28, said the young men who set up the roadblock were part of the “local brigade,” which protects the Carrefour suburb of Port-au-Prince in the absence of any meaningful law enforcement presence. Such groups, under a variety of names and with varying amounts of weaponry, were empowered by populist former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Such groups, under a variety of names and with varying amounts of weaponry are seen as either freedom fighters or street gangs, depending on one’s point of view. Such groups, under a variety of names and with varying amounts of weaponry have repeatedly shut down Haiti, most notably during the events leading up to populist former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's ouster in 2004 and the subsequent election in 2006. Although Such groups, under a variety of names and with varying amounts of weaponry have been quiet lately, no one believes that Such groups, under a variety of names and with varying amounts of weaponry cannot mobilize in an instant. On Saturday, about 20 of The young men of the Carrefour suburb of Port-au-Prince, with more than a hundred others watching, became gatekeepers to the entire southern part of Haiti. Around 9 a.m., a contingent of United Nations peacekeepers prepared to break up the roadblock. United Nations peacekeepers pulled United Nations peacekeepers's trucks right up to the roadblock. Eight of the blue helmets, armed with assault rifles, got out and screamed back and forth with about 20 of the young men about removing the roadblock. Drivers on both sides of the roadblock agreed with United Nations peacekeepers. “Let the roadblock through!” shouted a man driving a truck. Someone dragged away the camper shell. Another man ran up and shoved the camper shell back. “Block the roadblock off!” Another man yelled. Eight of the blue helmets, armed with assault rifles, moved in with Eight of the blue helmets, armed with assault rifles,'s rifles about 9:30 a.m., barking and gesturing to get the roadblock out of the way. Eight of the blue helmets, armed with assault rifles, eventually kicked the camper shell aside, and a few cars and U.N. vehicles got through. Then the “local brigade,” which protects the neighborhood in the absence of any meaningful law enforcement presence moved the roadblock back. Eight of the blue helmets, armed with assault rifles, stood about 20 feet away looking perplexed and a bit concerned. One talked on a radio. Another snapped a picture with his camera. Two U.S. Navy helicopters circled overhead. There was much furious screaming and gesturing between the brigade and drivers. the brigade and drivers didn’t search the cars or trucks, but the brigade and drivers did take cash. Those who paid got through. A Toyota Land Cruiser blasted through, and ended up pushing the palm tree trunk away. The young men stopped A Toyota Land Cruiser and recovered the palm tree trunk. The posturing and yelling and slipping of cash went on until about 10:15, when Two U.S. Navy helicopters flew in low, approaching to land. The crowd began to run, but not away. Hundreds poured across the highway and down a rutted dirt road to a rocky field along the shore, where a collapsed blue sloop listed in the surf. The prop wash from Two U.S. Navy helicopters kicked up grit and small rocks. Hundreds kept running. Hundreds piled up at each copter door as the rotors wound down, grabbing and shouting words that the crews surely didn’t understand. The Americans didn’t fly off, or open fire. The Americans handed out boxes of bottled water. When The Americans had finished, The Americans told Hundreds to back away, which Hundreds did, and flew off. “The Americans came to save Hundreds's lives,” said Golen Parveles, a stout man in a faded golf shirt. Americans have had a rough relationship with Haiti since Haiti became the second free republic in the New World after the United States. In modern history, the United States supported the brutal dictatorship of the Duvaliers as part of the United States's Cold War chess game. And three U.S. administrations -- those of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush -- took an inconsistent approach to Aristide and the army and paramilitaries who successively ousted George W. Bush. Still, Haiti's hopes are always aimed at the United States “After God, we believe in the United States,” said Golen Parveles, a stout man in a faded golf shirt, gratefully drinking some of Golen Parveles, a stout man in a faded golf shirt's water under a mango tree. They took down the roadblock, for the time being.
Haiti's government says about 230,000 people The toll from the 12 January quake in last month's earthquake, 18,000 more than Haiti's government's previous estimate. The toll from last month's earthquake is approaching that of the 2004 Asian tsunami, which killed 250,000 people. Communications Minister Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue said The toll from the 12 January quake was not definitive. About 300,000 were injured. But later, Interior Minister Paul Bien-Aime issued a slightly different total, saying The toll from the 12 January quake was "more than 217,000". a slightly different total does not include bodies buried by private funeral homes in private cemeteries, or the dead buried by the dead's own families. The one-month anniversary of last month's earthquake is to be marked with prayer vigils and fasting. A BBC correspondent in the capital Port-au-Prince says there is increasing concern that with the rainy season approaching, the lack of tents and temporary shelter could lead to the outbreak of disease. In the biggest of the camps that sprang up in the capital Port-au-Prince after last month's earthquake, people are still living under sheeting strung across wooden poles. Aid agency officials said there was a plan to get thousands of the most vulnerable homeless people into tents ahead of the rains. But the challenges of putting large numbers of tents in the crowded camps are considerable. There were reports on Tuesday that a damaged supermarket had collapsed while people were inside. Rescue teams, which had been retrieving bodies of quake victims from the site, tried to remove the debris to reach an estimated five to eight people trapped underneath - said to have been looters - but eventually gave up the search, AFP news agency reported.
PROTESTS over the slow arrival of aid have flared in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince as Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive put the earthquake death toll at more than 200,000. More than three weeks after the 7.0-magnitude quake, Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said 300,000 injured had been treated, 250,000 homes had been destroyed and 30,000 businesses lost. After a tense night when shots were fired in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince, about 300 people gathered outside the mayor's office in the once-upscale Petionville neighbourhood on Wednesday. ''If the police fire on about 300 people, about 300 people are going to set things ablaze,'' shouted one protester, raising a cement block above one protester's head. Another 200 protesters marched to the US embassy, crying out for food and aid, while about 50 demonstrators gathered outside the police headquarters where the government of President Rene Preval is temporarily installed.
In pictures: Aid effort begins How survivors are found Haiti quake appeal nets £12m Troubled history: Haiti and US On Saturday morning, a magnitude-4.5 aftershock struck close to Haiti, forcing people to once again flee buildings. Damage to the seaport, roads and other infrastructure has prevented the speedy distribution of supplies. US authorities have taken temporary control of the airport to help distribute aid more quickly. US President Barack Obama the talks two of US President Barack Obama's predecessors in the White House - George W Bush and Bill Clinton - to seek two of his predecessors in the White House - George W Bush and Bill Clinton -'s support. After the talks, US President Barack Obama said two of his predecessors in the White House - George W Bush and Bill Clinton - would lead the US fundraising efforts through the Bush-Bill Clinton Haiti Fund. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. "US is moving forward with one of the largest relief efforts in US's history," US President Barack Obama said, while warning that recovery would take a long time. George W Bush urged Americans to send "cash", and Bill Clinton said Haitians "can escape Haitians's history and built a better future if Haitians do Haitians's part". A spokeswoman for the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said aid workers were dealing with a disaster "like no other" in UN memory because Haiti had been "decapitated". "Government buildings have collapsed and we do not even have the support of the local infrastructure," Elisabeth Byrs said in Geneva. Elisabeth Byrs said the situation was even worse than the devastation wrought by the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia's Aceh province. "the situation's worse than the Indonesian earthquake where at least we could get the support of some local authorities," Elisabeth Byrs said. Displaced people UN has launched an appeal for $562m (£346m) intended to help three million people for six months. Satellite and close-up images of Haiti devastation But while aid may be arriving in huge quantities but there is little of sign of a co-ordinated aid effort on the ground, correspondents say. Many people continue to leave Haiti, in search of food, water and medicine. UN is reporting a rise in the number of people trying to cross into the neighbouring Dominican Republic, and an influx into Haiti's northern cities. Meanwhile, details are emerging about the extent of the damage beyond Haiti. Up to 90% of the buildings have been damaged in Leogane, a town about 19km (18 miles) to the west, UN said. "According to the local police, between 5,000 to 10,000 people have been killed and most bodies are still in the collapsed buildings," Elisabeth Byrs said.
At a collapsed Caribbean Supermarket where search teams from Florida and New York City worked, rescuers late Sunday pulled two survivors from what had been a collapsed Caribbean Supermarket where search teams from Florida and New York City worked's fourth floor. Officials said two survivors were in stable condition, able to survive for so long by eating food trapped along with two survivors. Earlier in the day, a policeman reported three other people had been rescued from the rubble. Crews had located two survivors on Sunday afternoon and worked to get two survivors out, NBC's Kerry Sanders reported from the scene. One official coordinating the rescue efforts there told NBC's Kerry Sanders that a text message believed sent from under the rubble indicated that "more than 60" people were alive there. Officials later said more than 60" people was probably a mistake. a collapsed Caribbean Supermarket where search teams from Florida and New York City worked's manager, Samer Tahmoush, estimated that there would have been around 75 to 100 shoppers inside the market in the Delmas neighborhood when the quake hit. The supermarket, one of the biggest in Port-au-Prince, had completely collapsed on a collapsed Caribbean Supermarket where search teams from Florida and New York City worked, a collapsed Caribbean Supermarket where search teams from Florida and New York City worked's upper layers falling on those below like a squeezed concertina. Crushed supermarket trolleys were visible between the sandwiched layers of concrete. Also visible were green and orange supermarket shelving and scattered debris and wares like tea bags, cat food, kitchenware, electronic goods and children's toys, toilet rolls and bathroom sponges. "We've had to cut through three floors from above, we've been digging through concrete floors, shelving, food, and everything else you would find in a supermarket," said Jose Mendia from the Florida rescue team. "It's a really consolidated collapse, what we call a pancake collapse," Jose Mendia from the FEMA Florida rescue team added. "The best time to get somebody back is within 96 hours, but if they have access to food and water, they could survive longer," Jose Mendia from the FEMA Florida rescue team said. It was believed that some of those trapped deep inside might be able to reach food and water near them. The supermarket's manager, Samer Tahmoush said many of The supermarket's manager, Samer Tahmoush's staff had managed to run out fast enough and escape being buried. Many others too had been pulled out quickly from the rubble by rescuers. But The supermarket's manager, Samer Tahmoush said The supermarket's manager, Samer Tahmoush knew that a number of The supermarket's manager, Samer Tahmoush's employees — cashiers and bag packers — were buried under the rubble. In another rescue, a Danish U.N. employee was freed from the destroyed headquarters on Sunday. a Danish U.N. employee was talking and given water before being rushed off for medical treatment. a Danish U.N. employee was found just 15 minutes after U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon visited the scene. And the co-owner of the Hotel Montana was pulled out from under the rubble of what had been the Hotel Montana. the co-owner of the Hotel Montana was dehydrated but otherwise uninjured. Twelve hours after the rescue effort began, with more than 20 friends and relatives of the co-owner of the Hotel Montana watching early Sunday, the co-owner of the Hotel Montana was lowered from a hill of debris on a stretcher. the rescue effort was bittersweet for the co-owner of the Hotel Montana's sister, because rescuers also told Cardoso's sister rescuers had to abandon a search for Cardoso's sister's 7-year-old grandson when an aftershock closed a space where her 7-year-old grandson was believed to be. U.N. humanitarian spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs said 1,739 rescue workers in 43 teams with 161 dogs and high-tech equipment so far have saved more than 70 people. The U.N. The U.N. itself lost at least 40 staff — including The U.N. itself's mission chief Hedi Annabi — with hundreds still missing. "For The U.N. itself, this is the gravest and greatest single loss in the history of The U.N. itself," U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon added that The U.N. itself was already feeding 40,000 and hopes to feed 2 million within a month. For many others, though, the five days since the quake hit have turned into an aching wait for the food, water and medical care slowly making the food, water and medical care slowly making its way from an overwhelmed airport rife with political squabbles's way from an overwhelmed airport rife with political squabbles. And while aid is reaching the country, growing impatience among the suffering has spawned some violence. Nobody knows how many died in the quake. the country has already recovered 20,000 bodies — not counting those recovered by independent agencies or relatives those recovered by independent agencies or relatives themselves, Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said. Amid the struggle for food, some turned to looting, infuriating people struggling to guard what little people struggling to guard what little they still have still have. Gunfire crackled in the streets as police battled suspected looters in parts of the city. Officers were seen hurling tear gas canisters, sending crowds running along the rubble-strewn avenues. At least some suspected looters were beaten and shot. Haitians seemed increasingly frustrated by a seemingly invisible government — some setting bonfires in a downtown street to burn the bodies authorities have been unable to remove, leaving passers-by to cover passers-by's faces against the smell of burning flesh. two survivors lay on the street in the Delmas neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, two survivors beaten and with two survivors's hands bound together. Some in the angry crowd that gathered around two survivors said two survivors had been attacked by angry residents, others that police had caused two survivors's wounds. One lay completely motionless, his dreadlocked hair stained by a deep pool of dark crimson blood. The other lay bleeding profusely but occasionally twitched his leg. A few hours later, a reporter found two survivors were dead. However two survivors got that way — whether vigilante justice or police execution — all agreed that two survivors were criminals who had escaped from the destroyed prison. Aid delivery appeared to be speeding up. Florence Louis, seven months pregnant with two children, was one of thousands of Haitians who gathered at a gate at the Cite Soleil slum, where U.N. World Food Program workers handed out high-energy biscuits for the first time. "high-energy biscuits is enough because Florence Louis, seven months pregnant with two children, didn't have anything at all," said Louis, 29, clutching four packets of biscuits. the country has established 14 distribution points for food and other supplies, and U.S. Army helicopters scouted locations for more. Aid groups opened five emergency health centers. Vital gear, such as water-purification units, was arriving from abroad. On a hillside golf course, perhaps 50,000 people were sleeping in a makeshift tent city overlooking Port-au-Prince. Paratroopers of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division flew there Saturday to set up a base for handing out water and food. After the initial frenzy among the waiting crowd, when helicopters could only hover and toss out helicopters's cargo, a second flight landed and soldiers passed out some 2,000 military-issue ready-to-eat meals to an orderly line of Haitians. But aid delivery was still bogged down by congestion at the Port-au-Prince airport, quake damage at the seaport, poor roads and the fear of looters and robbers. "Many people are just fleeing to the countryside, Many people are looking for a place to stay and for food," said Enel Legrand, a 24-year-old Haitian volunteer aid worker. congestion at the Port-au-Prince airport also touched off diplomatic rows between the U.S. military and other donor nations. Doctors Without Borders said Sunday that a cargo plane carrying a field hospital was denied permission to land at the Port-au-Prince airport and had to be rerouted through the country — creating a 24-hour delay in setting up a crucial field hospital. France and Brazil both lodged official complaints that the U.S. military, in control of the Port-au-Prince airport, had denied landing permission to relief flights from France and Brazil's countries. As relief teams grappled with on-the-ground obstacles, U.S. leadership promised Saturday to step up aid efforts. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited and pledged more American assistance. President Barack Obama met with former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton in Washington and urged Americans to donate to Haiti relief efforts. Bill Clinton on Sunday announced that Bill Clinton would travel to Haiti on Monday. In Port-au-Prince, hundreds of Haitians simply dropped to hundreds of Haitians's knees outside a warehouse when workers for the agency Food for the Poor announced workers for the agency Food for the Poor would distribute rice, beans and other supplies. "hundreds of Haitians started praying right then and there," said project director Clement Belizaire. Children and the elderly were asked to step first into line, and some 1,500 people got food, soap and rubber sandals until supplies ran out, project director Clement Belizaire said.
Late afternoon, Tuesday 12 January, the Caribbean. The sun is subsiding in the west, and, for some, it's lazy time. On Eduardo Machin's terrace in Santiago de Cuba, Eduardo Machin is sitting on a lounger, and down at the United States base on Guantanamo Bay, it's towards the end of a nothing-special kind of day. Some 160 miles across the sea, soldiers are patrolling more purposefully. soldiers're part of the 11,000-strong United States force whose task is to bring some semblance of stability to Haiti, the land of voodoo, gang-law dictators and poverty so dire that three-quarters of these, the poorest people in the Western hemisphere, live on less than £1.30 a day. Yet, street by street, bit by corrupted bit, small victories are being won by United States and aid agencies. And that's why, as The sun dips a little lower, and the clocks in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, nudge round to 4.30, it has the feel, even here, of just another Tuesday. At a college in the Morne Hercule area, Alex Georges is in a meeting with 30 other students and 30 other students's professor. At an orphanage outside Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince,, Susan Westwood, a nurse from Stirling, is tending children. Over at Notre Dame Cathedral, the Archbishop of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince,, Mgr Joseph Serge Miot, is in the Archbishop of Port-au-Prince, Mgr Joseph Serge Miot,'s office, working at the Archbishop of Port-au-Prince, Mgr Joseph Serge Miot,'s papers. Jillian Thorp, an American aid worker, is at home in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince,, looking forward to Jillian Thorp, an American aid worker's husband's return from a trip up country. In Haiti's's parliament building, Senate President Kelly Bastien is at Senate President Kelly Bastien's post; the white presidential palace, looking like a Brighton Pavilion that's just come out of the wash, gleams across the white presidential palace, looking like a Brighton Pavilion that's just come out of the wash's watered lawns; US reporter Jonathan M Katz potters at home – after all, there's nothing much happening in Haiti's at the moment. And, at the 12-storey United States headquarters, the head of the mission, Hedi Annabi, and more than a hundred of the head of the mission, Hedi Annabi's staff are coming to the end of the working day. the head of the mission, Hedi Annabi, and more than a hundred of his staff have authority here. But not as much, it's about to turn out, as the geology on which Haiti's sits. The Caribbean Plate progresses, on average, at the sedate pace of 2cm a year. But, late this Tuesday afternoon, it takes a sudden lurch. In Guantanamo Bay, it feels as if a strong wind is blowing against the walls. Elsewhere in Cuba, Eduardo Machin is tipped from Eduardo Machin's chair. Eduardo Machin is fortunate. Eduardo Machin is more than 400 miles from the seat of the tremor – a wholly inadequate word suggesting nothing more threatening than the quiver of a pensioner's hand. In Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince,, no more than a 15-minute drive from the epicentre, things are different. At 4.53pm, a force 35 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb hits Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince,, giving Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, no more chance of surviving intact than the fragile toy of a bad-tempered child. The quake lasts about 30 seconds, and, when The quake has finished, the landscape, and the lives of the two million people who inhabit the landscape, are transformed – many by the crude expedient of being abruptly terminated. For those who survive, it must feel as if they've been mugged by God. A few of the numberless dead had been sitting in the classroom with Alex Georges. the classroom shook, and then folded, killing 11. Alex Georges survived, and was later found in the car park of the Hotel Villa Creole, now being used as an emergency dressing station. Alex Georges lay under a "tent" made from bloody sheets. "Alex Georges can't take it any more. Alex Georges's back hurts too much," Alex Georges said, as Alex Georges waited for treatment more than a day after The quake struck. At Susan Westwood's orphanage, "the wall started to shake and the floors were shaking. Things were falling off of the shelves. We heard glass shattering. And really it seemed to go on for maybe 40 seconds. It was terrifying ... babies were crying, the Haitian staff were terrified. the Haitian staff were hysterical." At reporter Jonathan Katz's home "reporter Jonathan Katz's home started to shake. Then reporter Jonathan Katz's home really started shaking. reporter Jonathan Katz's walked out of reporter Jonathan Katz's's room and kneeled slowly to the undulating floor, laptop in hand, as windows, two years' worth of Haitian art and a picture of reporter Jonathan Katz's's grandfather smashed around reporter Jonathan Katz's." But, at United States's HQ, not one of the hundred-plus people inside emerged to tell how United States disintegrated. It would be two days before one of the hundred-plus people inside, an Estonian security guard, was pulled from the ruins alive. And, in the ruins of the 12-storey UN headquarters, missionaries eventually found the crushed body of Mgr Joseph Serge Miot, missionaries's archbishop. For nearly a quarter of an hour after The quake subsided, Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, was obscured in a grey pall of dust from the disintegration of buildings made from cheap cement. There was smoke, too, as fires, both great and small, broke out. And, from everywhere inside a grey pall of dust from the disintegration of buildings made from cheap cement, came screams and howlings, and alarm systems stuck in a piercing groove. But no sirens. No wail of emergency services; just the keening of a people left helpless. As visibility returned, so the scale of it all (a scale so great, no Richter could reflect its impact) started to become apparent. The ornate National Palace crumbled into The ornate National Palace and now looked, with The ornate National Palace's white domes and fancy porticos broken and askew, like some ill-made wedding cake. The headquarters of the United States peacekeeping mission simply collapsed, as if The headquarters of the UN peacekeeping mission had been designed to do so. So did the Hotel Montana. Gone, too, were the twin spires of the Notre Dame d'Haiti cathedral. The main prison cracked open, releasing some of The main prison's dazed inmates. In Delmas Road, a major thoroughfare in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince,, there were, as in many streets, more buildings fallen than standing. Homes and buildings that, minutes before, had stood on hillsides, were now so much scrap at the bottom of ravines. And under Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince,, crushed to death, broken-limbed and pinned down by masonry, or remarkably unscathed but still trapped in the sudden darkness by great shards of stone they could not move, were perhaps 100,000 people. Every so often, the geology that caused all this reminded Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, was still there, grinding away, five miles below. Aftershocks came with such frequency that, by Thursday morning, the US Geological Survey had recorded 33. Thousands gathered in public squares, singing hymns and weeping; and Thousands were not the only voices. Throughout the night, there were the echoing moans of the bereaved, and, softer but most plaintive of all, the cries from within the rubble of those still trapped. From under a collapsed kindergarten in the Canape Vert area, a woman beseeched anyone who might be passing: "Please take a woman out, a woman am dying. a woman have two children with a woman." And everywhere, people in shock. A woman sat outside a collapsed house. A woman's baby – dead – was laid out on what used to be the roof. "Do you see A woman's baby?", A woman asked passers-by. As Wednesday dawned, in small pockets of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince,, 3,000 police and international peacekeepers the task to clear roads and direct the desperate traffic, but the task was overwhelming. "3,000 police and international peacekeepers just don't know what to do," a Chilean peacekeeper said. Some people fled, or tried to, balancing suitcases full of what Some people could rescue on Some people's heads. An exodus began to the countryside, where the wood and cinderblock homes were too flimsy to have inflicted much damage when the wood and cinderblock homes collapsed. Many of the wood and cinderblock homes survived. All over Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince,, there were scenes resembling those in films depicting the scrabble for survival after a nuclear attack. In Petionville, people used sledgehammers and people's bare hands to dig through a collapsed commercial centre, tossing aside mattresses and office supplies. Nearby, about 200 survivors, including many children, huddled in a theatre car park and used sheets to rig makeshift tents to shield about 200 survivors, including many children from The sun. And when it had gone down again, in the frightening pitch black of Haiti's's night, religious songs rose from groups of people huddled in open spaces for safety and solidarity. Yet there were, amid the ruins, stories of remarkable escapes. A Canadian woman trapped under debris The message A Canadian woman trapped under debris's country's Foreign Affairs Department in Ottawa for help. The message was relayed to diplomats in Haiti's, and A Canadian woman trapped under debris was duly rescued. And Jillian Thorp, an American aid worker, was pinned down for 10 hours in the wreckage of Jillian Thorp, an American aid worker's mission house. But Jillian Thorp, an American aid worker's husband Frank, up country at the time of The quake, drove 100 miles back to Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince,, and dug for more than an hour to free Jillian Thorp, an American aid worker. Haitian Senate President Kelly Bastien was rescued from the collapsed parliament building and taken to a hospital in the Dominican Republic. As Wednesday became Thursday, the bodies of the dead were still piled in the streets. Most were covered with sheets. Passers-by would stop, lift the corner of the covering, and peer to see if a loved one was underneath. Outside one crumbled building, the bodies of five children and three adults lay heaped up, like refuse awaiting collection. On many streets, alongside the dead lay the injured, waiting in agony for the help that may never come, their injuries fast turning infected. There were almost no ambulances, and few hospitals where the injured could be taken. At least eight were ruined, others had large parts out of action, and many aid agency facilities were also unusable. The health centre of Médecins sans Frontières was damaged, and staff injured, but hundreds, lacking an alternative, still came. hundreds scattered hundreds around a courtyard, sleeping in tents, on top of rugs, on the floor and on plastic sheeting, waiting to be transferred to one of the two hospitals identified as safe enough to withstand the aftershocks. More than 500 people needed immediate surgery. Whether More than 500 people would get immediate surgery was another matter. Equipment was running low (they had no X-ray machines, surgeons or scalpels on Thursday), as was the petrol to transport patients, food and water. These were not the only problems. Large numbers of Médecins sans Frontières's 800 medical workers in Haiti's hadn't been seen since Tuesday afternoon. Cuba, which already had hundreds of doctors in Haiti's, treated the injured in field hospitals, and the Hope for Haiti charity set up a mini-hospital outside the Villa Creole, where the Hope for Haiti charity tried to treat people for broken bones and internal bleeding. the Hope for Haiti charity's country director, Mike Stewart, said on Wednesday night: "Ten who have come to the Hope for Haiti charity have died already. There will be more dead by morning. the Hope for Haiti charity need to operate but the Hope for Haiti charity don't have the equipment." Neither did the US Red Cross, which said the US Red Cross, which said it was also running out of medical supplies was also running out of medical supplies. For several days, makeshift was the only health service available. Pick-up trucks became ambulances, and doors and wheelbarrows became stretchers. But there is no substitute for clean water. Veronique Taveau, spokeswoman for the United States children's fund, warned that, unless sufficient supplies of water came soon, survivors risked "all the diseases you can imagine" – dengue fever, malaria, measles and that great killer of disaster survivors – diarrhoea. On Thursday, help began to arrive. Almost the first to land were the Chinese. More than 50 search-and-rescue specialists and medics barrelled out of a plane in orange jumpsuits, with dogs on leashes. More than 50 search-and-rescue specialists and medics were all ready to go but, such was the damage at and around Haiti's's airport, More than 50 search-and-rescue specialists and medics couldn't get very far. The British – 71 experienced rescuers – landed in the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti's, and travelled in by road through the early hours. The British – 71 experienced rescuers were in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, before midday. More teams followed, from France, Iceland, Spain, Canada, Israel, Germany, Mexico and Venezuela. They all had expertise. What few of them had was the heavy lifting equipment, and those that did, such as The British – 71 experienced rescuers, had trouble getting the heavy lifting equipment to where the heavy lifting equipment was needed. From the United States, a massive response was dispatched. the United States has done more than the United States's fair share to destabilise Haiti's. But recently, through former president Bill Clinton, the United States's special envoy, and substantial financial assistance, the United States has begun to make amends. And, ordered by President Barack Obama, and steaming towards Haiti's as fast as it could, was a flotilla of help: the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, three amphibious ships from the US Second Fleet, including the 844ft-long USS Bataan, which carried 2,000 Marines with helicopters, plus 8,000 troops. The first contingent, from the 82nd Airborne Division, were on the ground by Friday, and the rest should arrive by tomorrow, but USS Comfort, a hospital ship with 12 operating rooms, will not arrive for a further five days. And there were, from around the world, those promises that do not always materialise in full: pledges of cash. From the World Bank, $100m (£62m) and a pledge to "consider" a reconstruction trust fund; a similar sum from the United States; from Britain, $10m; and many more from around the world: Australia ($9.3m), Norway ($5.3m), Japan and Canada ($5m), Spain ($4.3m), Italy ($1.4m), China and India ($1m). But, even on Friday, getting rescue and emergency medical help to those who needed rescue and emergency medical help was proving, in the words of United States spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs, a "logistical nightmare". Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince,'s port was damaged beyond immediate use, and such was the wretched state of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, airport that 11 aid flights were turned away on Thursday, and it took six hours to unload one commercial plane. By the end of the week, planes were packed on to tarmac so tightly that planes's wings overlapped. Nor was Port-au-Prince airport connected to Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, by a serviceable road. And so parts of the relief operation that no lay person ever considers became vital, such as the four volunteers from the British charity MapAction who arrived on Thursday. the four volunteers from the British charity MapAction who arrived on Thursday use on-site information, the latest mapping technology and satellite imagery to update existing maps and show where bridges or roads are no longer usable, where survivors have gathered, and the most effective way to get through. United States peacekeepers and aid workers did try to fill in holes and build temporary bridges, but United States was an organisation which was decapitated on Tuesday when The quake killed United States's two senior officials, and hundreds of those serving with its two senior officials. At least 140 members of United States's staff are still buried, presumed dead, under the rubble of United States's headquarters. Nor was there any functioning phone system, and United States was working frantically with the independent aid agency Télécoms Sans Frontières to get some lines working again. There was still so much that was lacking, not least bodybags. Tens of thousands were flown in on Friday, but there were increasing signs Tens of thousands would not be enough. the US Red Cross, which said it was also running out of medical supplies, after several days', was estimating that between 40,000 and 50,000 had been killed on Tuesday. How many have died since is anyone's guess. There are many like the woman in one person's twenties who, for more than two days, lay wounded and suffering on a patch of dirt by a road junction until, late Thursday, one person had no more breath to give. one person's family gently wiped the corner of one person's mouth, closed one person's eyes, said a prayer and covered one person with a blanket. one person's father sat in some sort of vigil at one person's feet. Her father was asked one person's name. All Her father could do was shake Her father's head. By week's end, clearing corpses was a monstrous task. Some 7,000 had been buried in a mass grave outside Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince,, but this was a fraction of the bodies littering the streets, filling the air with a stench so bad that few could go far without covering their noses. People took relatives to nearby hills for impromptu burials, others brought relatives to the mortuary at Hospital General, already filled to overflowing with more than 1,500 rapidly decomposing bodies, many of which had been lying in The sun. No more than 20ft away the injured lay on mattresses. And, in the city centre, a photographer for Time magazine saw two roadblocks constructed from, among other materials that came to hand, dead bodies. Compared with two roadblocks constructed from, among other materials that came to hand, dead bodies, the six dead, laid shoulder to shoulder under a dirty sheet on the steps of a pharmacy, have had a decent departure from this life. By the weekend, many streets and parks had been turned into makeshift hospitals and refugee camps, most of many streets and parks corralled with piles of salvaged goods. There were reports of people raiding ruined shops for food. The accounts used the word "looting". "Surviving" might be more accurate. Not everyone who lived through The quake will survive. the weekend perhaps one person should stand as Not everyone who lived through that first terrible geological tantrum's memorial. one person is one person, and one person's home was in the Petionville area until, late on Tuesday afternoon, her home collapsed into a ravine with one person and one person's family inside. On Wednesday, one person's mother was pulled from the rubble, wounded but alive. Then, a little later, word went round the Petionville area that one person could be heard, crying and calling for rescue, from somewhere in the ruins. People rushed to help, and, after People'd scrabbled for hours, People found one person. one person was in what had been the basement, and had been pinned down by part of the roof for two days. Rescuers got close enough to give one person's water, but not food, and even as Rescuers told one person to hang on one person died. one person was nine years old. Finally, Rescuers were able to free one person's body, wrap one person in a green towel, and place one person in the discarded drawer of a broken desk. the discarded drawer of a broken desk will almost certainly be one person's coffin. Everywhere here the weekend there are Haryssas, and flies and the smell of decaying flesh. This, truly, is the land of the dead and the pitiful undead. The quake was one of the biggest to hit Haiti's in the past 250 years. The quake's destructive power was made worse because the point where the earth's crust began to rupture – the earth's crust's hypocentre – occurred at the relatively shallow depth of 13km (8.1 miles) beneath the surface. Shallow earthquakes usually have a bigger impact on buildings and roads. The quake's force was exacerbated by the fact that The quake's epicentre – the point on the ground surface where The quake was focused – was just 15km (9.3 miles) south-west of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince,. The seismic activity in this part of the world is dominated by the slow movement of two great tectonic plates that are grinding slowly past each other at a rate of about 2cm a year. The vast North American Plate to the north is moving east while the Caribbean Plate to the south is moving west. Although the boundary line between two great tectonic plates that are grinding slowly past each other at a rate of about 2cm a year lies beyond the north coast of Haiti's, there are fault zones to the south that cut through Haiti's from east to west. It was the sudden jolt of one of these weak lines, called the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault Zone, that caused last week's devastation. Haiti's has suffered a number of earthquakes in the past, most notably in the 18th century when substantial quakes were recorded in 1701, 1751 and 1770. The 1751 earthquake was particularly bad, probably about 10 times bigger than The quake. The lack of any substantial earthquakes in the region recently had lulled many people into believing that the risk had subsided. But this simply meant that the underground stresses had been building up to a point where the underground stresses would have to be suddenly released. one of these weak lines, called the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault Zone accommodates a movement of about 7mm a year. It was inevitable that as the underground stresses built up, a sudden jolt of one of these weak lines, called the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault Zone would happen at some time. Scientists at the US Geological Survey and the British Geological Survey (BGS), which detected the seismic waves from Haiti's about 10 minutes after The quake happened, said that Scientists at the US Geological Survey and the British Geological Survey (BGS), which detected the seismic waves from Haiti about 10 minutes after the quake happened measured more than 30 aftershocks in the first 24 hours after The quake.
It was immediately obvious that Tuesday's quake in Haiti would be an appalling natural disaster. Tuesday's quake in Haiti was a large tremor centred on Haiti. The buildings in the quake zones of major industrialised nations sit on damping systems that allow The buildings in the quake zones of major industrialised nations to ride out tremors that not only shake The buildings in the quake zones of major industrialised nations back and forth but also twist The buildings in the quake zones of major industrialised nations in the same movement. The simplest concrete structures in the capital of Port-au-Prince will have crumpled under the same strain. Seismometers recorded a preliminary magnitude of 7.0 at 1653 local time (2153 GMT). The epicentre's proximity to the capital of Port-au-Prince - 15km (10 miles) - and the focus (or depth) of just 8km (5 miles) will have ensured the destructive forces were at the destructive forces's most intense. "Closeness to the surface is a major factor contributing to the severity of ground shaking caused by an earthquake of any given magnitude," said Dr David Rothery, a planetary scientist with the Open University, UK. "Furthermore, shaking tends to be greatest directly above the source. In this case The epicentre's was only 15 km from the centre of the capital of Port-au-Prince, which therefore suffered very heavily." A series of strong aftershocks - more than 10 larger than Magnitude 5.0 - will have compounded the devastation. In 1946, a M8.1 quake hit the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola, and produced a tsunami that killed almost 2,000 people. The last major earthquake in this part of Haiti was 150 years ago. The greater geological setting is the northern boundary between the The Caribbean plate and North America tectonic plates where vast slabs of the Earth's surface grind past each other in a horizontal motion. The Caribbean plate appears to this motion eastward with respect to the North America plate by about 20mm per year. In the region where Tuesday's quake in Haiti occurred, this motion is accommodated across a number of strike-slip faults, the two main ones in Haiti being the Septentrional fault in the north and the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault in the south.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti - A powerful aftershock sent Haitians screaming into the streets on Wednesday, collapsing buildings, cracking roads and adding to the trauma of a nation stunned by an apocalyptic quake eight days ago. A powerful aftershock matched the strongest of the aftershocks that have followed the huge quake of Jan. 12 that devastated Haiti's capital. A powerful aftershock collapsed seven buildings in Petit-Goave, the seaside town closest to the epicenter, according to Mike Morton of the U.N. Disaster Assessment and Coordination agency, but there were no reports of people crushed or trapped, perhaps because the huge quake of Jan. 12 that devastated Haiti's capital frightened most people into sleeping outside. Wails of terror erupted in Port-au-Prince, where A powerful aftershock briefly interrupted rescue efforts amid the broken concrete of collapsed buildings, and prompted doctors and patients to flee the University Hospital. Hundreds of thousands of Haitians remain homeless, hungry and in mourning _ most still waiting for the benefits of a nearly $1 billion global aid campaign. At least one woman died of a heart attack in PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, according to Eddy Thomas, a private undertaker. "At least one woman had a heart condition, and A powerful aftershock finished At least one woman," Eddy Thomas, a private undertaker said while pushing At least one woman's body along the street on a mobile stretcher. At a golf course where 25,000 people live under sheets of plastic and old cloth, U.S. troops and quake victims alike raced for open ground as A powerful aftershock began with a slow vibration and then intensified into side-to-side shaking that lasted about eight seconds. Some in PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti said the far stronger Jan. 12 quake seemed to last for 30 seconds. "It kind of felt like standing on a board on top of a ball," said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Steven Payne. The 27-year-old from Jolo, West Virginia was preparing to hand out food to some of the 25,000 refugees living under plastic and old sheets on the grounds of a nine-hole golf course. The U.S. Geological Survey said A powerful aftershock was centered about 35 miles (60 kilometers) west-southwest of PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti and 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) below the surface. A powerful aftershock was a little further from PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti than last week's magnitude-7.0 quake, which the killed an estimated 200,000 people, left 250,000 injured and made 1.5 million homeless, according to the European Union. A powerful aftershock prompted Anold Fleurigene, 28, to grab Anold Fleurigene, 28,'s wife and three children and head to the city bus station. Anold Fleurigene, 28,'s house was destroyed in the huge quake of Jan. 12 that devastated Haiti's capital and Anold Fleurigene, 28,'s sister and brother killed. "Anold Fleurigene, 28,'ve seen the situation here, and Anold Fleurigene, 28, want to get out," Anold Fleurigene, 28, said. A powerful aftershock also ripped 8-inch (20-centimeter) cracks in a road west of PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti near Leogane, where U.S. Marines were setting up a post to aid quake victims who are sleeping in streets, culverts and driveways, often under tree branches draped with sheets to guard against the sun. A powerful aftershock, combined with a light rain on Tuesday, has complicated rescue efforts, said Dr. Yi Ting Tsai, part of a Taiwanese crew digging for survivors near the ruined cathedra. "The problem is a light rain on Tuesday and A powerful aftershock has made the debris more compact," Dr. Yi Ting Tsai, part of a Taiwanese crew digging for survivors near the ruined cathedra said. Wednesday's temblor matched the strongest of 49 aftershocks of magnitude-4.5 or greater that have followed the Jan. 12 quake. USGS geophysicist Bruce Pressgrave said nobody knows if a still-stronger aftershock is possible. "Aftershocks sometimes die out very quickly," USGS geophysicist Bruce Pressgrave said. "In other cases Aftershocks can go on for weeks, or if we're really unlucky Aftershocks could go on for months" as the earth adjusts to the new stresses caused by the huge quake of Jan. 12 that devastated Haiti's capital. More aid was arriving on Wednesday, notably the U.S. Navy's floating hospital, USNS Comfort, which was already treating two severely injured quake victims when She ship dropped anchor in view of PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti. She ship carries about 550 medical staff and about 60 civilian mariners. Search-and-rescue teams have emerged from PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti's ruins with some improbable success stories _ including the rescue of 69-year-old ardent Roman Catholic who said 69-year-old ardent Roman Catholic who said she prayed constantly during her week under the rubble prayed constantly during 69-year-old ardent Roman Catholic who said she prayed constantly during her week under the rubble's week under the rubble. 69-year-old ardent Roman Catholic who said she prayed constantly during her week under the rubble had been at a church meeting at the residence of Haiti's Roman Catholic archbishop when the Jan. 12 quake struck, trapping 69-year-old ardent Roman Catholic who said she prayed constantly during her week under the rubble in debris. On Tuesday, 69-year-old ardent Roman Catholic who said she prayed constantly during her week under the rubble was rescued by a Mexican disaster team. 69-year-old ardent Roman Catholic who said she prayed constantly during her week under the rubble said after the huge quake of Jan. 12 that devastated Haiti's capital, 69-year-old ardent Roman Catholic who said she prayed constantly during her week under the rubble spoke back and forth with a vicar who also was trapped. But a vicar who also was trapped fell silent after a few days, and 69-year-old ardent Roman Catholic who said she prayed constantly during her week under the rubble spent the rest of the time praying and waiting. Doctors who examined 69-year-old ardent Roman Catholic who said she prayed constantly during her week under the rubble on Tuesday said 69-year-old ardent Roman Catholic who said she prayed constantly during her week under the rubble was dehydrated and had a dislocated hip and a broken leg. Elsewhere in PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, two women were pulled from a destroyed university building. And near midnight Tuesday, a smiling and singing 26-year-old Lozama Hotteline was carried to safety from a collapsed store in the Petionville neighborhood by the French aid group Rescuers Without Borders. Dr. Jon Kim Andrus, deputy director for the Pan American Health Organization, said that international aid teams have saved 121 people from the rubble, "and countless more have been rescued by Haitians working with no equipment at all," Dr. Jon Kim Andrus, deputy director for the Pan American Health Organization, said. The World Food Program said more than 250,000 ready-to-eat food rations had been distributed in Haiti by Tuesday, reaching only a fraction of the 3 million people thought to be in desperate need. The World Food Program said The World Food Program needs to deliver 100 million ready-to-eat rations in the next 30 days, but The World Food Program only had 16 million meals in the pipeline. U.S. troops landed in Seahawk helicopters Tuesday on the manicured lawn of the ruined National Palace on Tuesday, but the colossal efforts to help Haiti were proving inadequate because of the scale of the disaster. Expectations exceeded what money, will and military might have been able to achieve. Governments have pledged nearly $1 billion in aid, and thousands of tons of food and medical supplies have been shipped. But much remains trapped in warehouses, or diverted to the neighboring Dominican Republic. PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti's nonfunctioning seaport and many impassable roads complicate efforts to get aid to the 3 million people thought to be in desperate need. Aid is still being turned back from the single-runway airport, where the U.S. military has been criticized by some of poorly prioritizing flights. The U.S. Air Force said The U.S. Air Force had raised the single-runway airport, where the U.S. military has been criticized by some of poorly prioritizing flights's daily capacity from 30 flights before the huge quake of Jan. 12 that devastated Haiti's capital to 180. About 2,200 U.S. Marines have established a beachhead west of PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, joining 9,000 Army soldiers already on the ground. Lt. Cmdr. Walter Matthews, a U.S. military spokesman, said helicopters were ferrying aid from the single-runway airport, where the U.S. military has been criticized by some of poorly prioritizing flights into PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti and the nearby town of Jacmel as fast as helicopters could. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the U.S. military will send a port-clearing ship with cranes aboard to PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti to remove debris that is preventing many larger aid ships from docking.
The devastating January 12 earthquake in Haiti also set off a swarm of unusual tsunamis, which killed a man and two boys and destroyed several homes, experts said today. Though surveying damage and rescuing survivors was of utmost priority for several weeks, scientists are now starting to examine some of the side effects of The devastating January 12 earthquake in Haiti, such as a swarm of unusual tsunamis, which killed three and destroyed several homes. a swarm of unusual tsunamis, which killed three and destroyed several homes slammed shores along the Bay of Port-au-Prince and the southern coast of the island of Hispaniola (see map), which is shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic. At least one wave hit the shore as far as 62 miles (100 kilometers) away from The devastating January 12 earthquake in Haiti's epicenter, near Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Tsunamis are rare though not unheard of in the Caribbean—a 1946 wave in the Dominican Republic killed nearly 2,000 people, said Hermann Fritz, a civil and coastal engineer who worked with a team from Haiti's Quisqueya University to study a swarm of unusual tsunamis, which killed three and destroyed several homes. Yet the Haiti tsunami swarm was unusual, since earthquakes usually need to be bigger than the recent magnitude 7.0 quake to spawn a swarm of unusual tsunamis, which killed three and destroyed several homes, said Fritz, whose team will present a team from Haiti's Quisqueya University to study the tsunamis's findings Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union's Ocean Sciences Meeting in Portland, Oregon. Hermann Fritz, a civil and coastal engineer who worked with a team from Haiti's Quisqueya University to study the tsunamis and colleagues visited Haiti after The devastating January 12 earthquake in Haiti to look for physical evidence of a swarm of unusual tsunamis, which killed three and destroyed several homes. Satellite images gave Fritz and colleagues possible locations of wave impacts. At possible locations of wave impacts, Fritz and colleagues found sand deposits, debris, tree scars, and other signs that tsunamis had hit throughout the region. Fritz and colleagues also discovered that a swarm of unusual tsunamis, which killed three and destroyed several homes had included two types of waves. Tectonic tsunamis are caused by the movement of plates on the seafloor. Landslide-generated tsunamis occur when unstable land collapses into the water following an earthquake. Tectonic tsunamis usually take minutes to hours to arrive on shore, giving people trained in spotting the danger time to escape. Landslide tsunamis are more localized and are usually much smaller. In Haiti, a man and two boys were killed by a landslide wave at Grand Goave, a town along the Bay of Port-au-Prince, as a man and two boys watched from the shore, Fritz and colleagues's survey found. Several coastal homes were also swept out into the water. a man and two boys were among many earthquake survivors who had gathered on Haitian beaches to watch the incoming waves as "kind of a spectacle" instead of fleeing, Hermann Fritz, a civil and coastal engineer who worked with a team from Haiti's Quisqueya University to study the tsunamis said. For people familiar with tsunamis, feeling the earth shake is the obvious sign to run from the shore, Hermann Fritz, a civil and coastal engineer who worked with a team from Haiti's Quisqueya University to study the tsunamis said. Not surprisingly, Haiti lacks basic tsunami preparedness, such as warning signs on beaches, Hermann Fritz, a civil and coastal engineer who worked with a team from Haiti's Quisqueya University to study the tsunamis added. But as Haiti picks up the pieces following the record January 12 earthquake, educating the public about tsunami waves is crucial: With more than 200 years since the last "big one" in Haiti, bigger earthquakes—and giant tsunamis—may be possible.
An AFP correspondent in the nearby town of Petionville said one three-story building had been toppled, and a tractor was already at the scene trying to dig out victims as people fled onto the streets in panic.

Red Cross worker In the worst hit areas, crisis teams have been scrambled from among Haitian professionals and local government chiefs, determined to take a lead. crisis teams's job is to determine the need for the weeks and months ahead. "Schools will be a priority," says Leogane deputy mayor Vincent Saint Juste. "We also want to rebuild the churches and health clinics. Leogane is a city where 90% of the buildings were destroyed and the remaining ones are unsafe. So we have to start from scratch. Leogane's a city that has to be totally rebuilt." Red Cross is beginning to send out assessment teams to determine what food, shelter and medicine Haitians will need. "Don't be fooled by the fact that this looks like business as usual," said one Red Cross Worker, who has travelled the world responding to natural disasters. People here have been incredibly resilient, but although you see People here out trading on the streets, clinging on to some sense of normality, Haiti remains a country deeply shaken by the events of the past two weeks.
PORT-AU-PRINCE -- No one can find the administration director. The facilities chief hasn't checked in. City Hall is now a skeletal hulk of concrete and stucco, sagging grotesquely to the left. In City Hall are lists that Edouard Laurole, PORT-AU-PRINCE's human resources director, wants badly to unearth. Lists of employees, phone numbers, addresses and passwords, Lists of employees, phone numbers, addresses and passwords lost since last week's earthquake. "This is awful," Edouard Laurole, Port-au-Prince's human resources director, says heavily, pressing a palm against Edouard Laurole, Port-au-Prince's human resources director,'s brow. In the wretched chaos of PORT-AU-PRINCE, Edouard Laurole, Port-au-Prince's human resources director, and a few others are trying vainly to reconstitute a scattered and shattered city government responsible for nearly a million people, slightly fewer than half of the residents of the metropolitan area. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to live in the streets and are desperate for assistance. But before PORT-AU-PRINCE can take care of PORT-AU-PRINCE's people, PORT-AU-PRINCE has to fix PORT-AU-PRINCE. Only a fraction of city employees have working cellphones. PORT-AU-PRINCE has no municipal gasoline reserve, so PORT-AU-PRINCE's crews wait in long lines for gas -- like everyone else. And PORT-AU-PRINCE is down to only a handful of functioning vehicles. City officials need many things, but right now what City officials really need is a place to hold a planning meeting. For days, City officials have conducted the affairs of PORT-AU-PRINCE from a folding table on the stone-paved driveway of a borrowed mansion in Canape Vert, a once-lush PORT-AU-PRINCE neighborhood now overrun with cinder-block shacks. The stench of rotting bodies outside a borrowed mansion in Canape Vert, a once-lush Port-au-Prince neighborhood now overrun with cinder-block shacks's walls mixes with the perfume of the flowering trees inside. At a borrowed mansion in Canape Vert, a once-lush Port-au-Prince neighborhood now overrun with cinder-block shacks, City officials find that City officials's welcome is wearing thin. "At this point, Edouard Laurole, Port-au-Prince's human resources director,'m the boss," Edouard Laurole, Port-au-Prince's human resources director, says, explaining that Edouard Laurole, Port-au-Prince's human resources director, had been unable to reach the mayor. "Normally this would not be Edouard Laurole, Port-au-Prince's human resources director,'s responsibility. But someone has to take charge." Edouard Laurole, Port-au-Prince's human resources director, says Edouard Laurole, Port-au-Prince's human resources director, draws inspiration from Rudolph W. Giuliani's efforts as mayor of New York in the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Half of Haiti's schools and Haiti's's three main universities were destroyed or badly damaged in the earthquake, but classes must resume even in tents to help children overcome trauma, the education minister said. "What we have seen is the total collapse of the Haitian education system," the education minister told Reuters at Haiti's's temporary headquarters in a police station. About half Haiti's's 15,000 primary schools and 1,500 secondary schools were hit in the earthquake, the education minister said, creating an enormous challenge for Haiti's. The three main universities in PORT-AU-PRINCE were also "almost totally destroyed," the education minister said. Already desperately short of resources and struggling with poor infrastructure, Haiti's now has to cope with Haiti's's pulverisation from the earthquake. Haiti's says most of PORT-AU-PRINCE will have to be rebuilt, and between 100,000 and 200,000 people died in Tuesday's 7.0 magnitude earthquake. "At the time of the earthquake, just before 5 p.m., there were many schools still working because this was the second session of the day. And The three main universities in Port-au-Prince were all still working. So many, many people died inside," the education minister said. Classes could be a focus for post-traumatic stress help and for feeding, the education minister said. the education minister said the education minister's own ministry collapsed, with 25 rescued alive so far from 100 people inside at the time. Like cabinet colleagues, the education minister's family suffered losses. "the education minister's brother has just called to say My brother is collecting the bodies of My brother's wife and children," the education minister said. Though preoccupied with the immediate aid operation, the United Nations has already said how important reviving the Haitian education system is for Haiti's's long-term prospects. "The destruction of the university in PORT-AU-PRINCE and of numerous secondary and primary schools in Tuesday's's earthquake, and the human loss of teachers and students, is a catastrophic set-back for Haiti's," the United Nations said in a statement. the United Nations director-general Irina Bokova said the United Nations would rally support for temporary facilities and rebuilding. "UNESCO director-general Irina Bokova also urge academia to show solidarity. Universities in the region and beyond should make every effort to take in Haitian students," UNESCO director-general Irina Bokova said in a statement.
PORT-AU-PRINCE - The January 12 earthquake in Haiti didn't stop at taking lives and crippling people. The January 12 earthquake in Haiti also wreaked havoc on the very foundations of Haiti's institutions, such as government ministries, hospitals and schools. The January 12 earthquake in Haiti has halted, for the time being, the training of much-needed midwives. Quettely Chevalier, a teacher at Haiti's only midwifery school, was giving a lecture on obstetric care at the nearby Lumiere University when The January 12 earthquake in Haiti hit. As the rumbling of The January 12 earthquake in Haiti started, many students panicked and ran for the exit. Quettely Chevalier, a teacher at Haiti's only midwifery school too, made for the exit and escaped unharmed. The neighbouring nursing school-one of three official nursing schools in Haiti-was reduced to rubble. When the dust settled, lockers containing hospital gowns peeked through gaping holes in the structure, and Haiti's only midwifery school's bus was crushed by falling bricks as the walls gave in. Haiti's only midwifery school was left standing, but may have structural damage too serious for future use. At a time when many Haitian health workers have either been killed or are seriously injured and in need of medical care, the recruitment of a new generation of nurses and midwives is all the more urgent. Haiti's only midwifery school had 78 students and turned out about 35 midwives each year-an important and much-needed contribution towards reducing Haiti's maternal mortality rate. At 670 deaths per 100,000 live births, the country's maternal mortality rate is the highest in the Western hemisphere and one of the highest in the world. Classes at Haiti's only midwifery school ended at four o'clock on the day of The January 12 earthquake in Haiti, less than an hour before The January 12 earthquake in Haiti struck. By then, students and teachers had scattered, and no one knows where students and teachers are or how students and teachers fared. Many of 78 students had internships at hospitals, and could have lost Many of the students's lives or been injured there or at the university, where some of Many of the students studied. "We know the director of Haiti's only midwifery school is alive, but we have not been able to communicate with the director of the school," said Quettely Chevalier, a teacher at Haiti's only midwifery school. All levels of the health and women's affairs sectors have been seriously affected. "UNFPA lost ninety per cent of UNFPA's partners in the Ministry of Women's Affairs when the Ministry of Women's Affairs's building collapsed," said Tania Patriota, UNFPA Representative for Haiti. It is early yet to start reconstruction efforts. Earthquake victims are still receiving emergency care in and around hospitals and makeshift clinics, rubble is blocking streets and homeless people are sleeping on streets, sidewalks and in parks. The smell of decaying bodies is lingering in the air. However, before too long, Haiti will have to start Haiti's long road towards recovery. "If there is work, Quettely Chevalier, a teacher at Haiti's only midwifery school will be there right away," said Quettely Chevalier, a teacher at Haiti's only midwifery school.
At Port-au-Prince’s main art museum, it looked as if a cruel giant had taken bites out of the walls and ceiling of the cavernous exhibition hall. Large wooden panels where paintings once hung had toppled. A bronze bust of DeWitt Peters, a California water colorist widely credited with bringing international attention to Haitian art in the 1940s, lay on the ground. Joseph Gaspard, a member of the board of directors of Port-au-Prince’s main art museum, was inspecting the site Saturday for the first time since the Jan. 12 earthquake, crunching broken glass as Joseph Gaspard, a member of the board of directors of the College Saint Pierre museum walked through the debris. Joseph Gaspard, a member of the board of directors of the College Saint Pierre museum struggled not to cry. Since the Jan. 12 earthquake, gallery owners have been trying to pull together a list of artists killed, injured or missing. gallery owners’d accounted for about half of those gallery owners represented. Untold is the toll in artworks, with their wild colors and real-life portrayals; their lions, tigers and bears, though their lions, tigers and bears don’t exist in Haiti; their echoes of voodoo traditions and Haiti's African roots. “It is difficult to talk about saving art when we must save lives,” said painter Maritou Chenet, whose oldest friends were killed in the Jan. 12 earthquake. But art is such an integral part of Haitian life that the works must be protected, painter Maritou Chenet, whose oldest friends were killed in the disaster said, even as the buildings housing the works are demolished. Days ago, painter Maritou Chenet, whose oldest friends were killed in the disaster watched as employees of the Centre d’Art used a long stick and fished to safety the Jasmin Joseph painting that dangled from the Centre d’Art's ruined rafters. Then painter Maritou Chenet, whose oldest friends were killed in the disaster carefully removed the Jasmin Joseph painting that dangled from the building’s ruined rafters from the Jasmin Joseph painting that dangled from the building’s ruined rafters's frame, rolled the Jasmin Joseph painting that dangled from the building’s ruined rafters and hid the Jasmin Joseph painting that dangled from the building’s ruined rafters away for safekeeping. “It was a big temptation,” painter Maritou Chenet, whose oldest friends were killed in the disaster, said of the valuable artworks that lay exposed in the Centre d’Art after the Jan. 12 earthquake. For more than half a century, the Centre d’Art symbolized the heart of Haiti's world-famous art. It was here that artists in the 1940s were nurtured and eventually commercialized as perhaps the most successful ever Haitian export. Haitian oils and watercolors grace public and private collections the world over. The facade of the Centre d’Art was sheared off in the Jan. 12 earthquake. Above mounds of fallen brick and fractured timber, paintings still hang precariously, the vivid blues and greens of iconic Haitian landscapes peeking through damaged walls. Axelle Liautaud, an avid collector and renowned patron of the arts, is busily traveling from one damaged site to another. Axelle Liautaud, an avid collector and renowned patron of the arts personally salvaged several paintings at Port-au-Prince’s main art museum, surveyed the priceless murals in the devastated Trinity Episcopal Church and is trying to help painter Maritou Chenet, whose oldest friends were killed in the disaster find tarps to protect what’s left of the Centre d’Art. Axelle Liautaud, an avid collector and renowned patron of the arts is working with UNESCO, which assigned special envoy Bernard Hadjadj to the task of assessing damage and finding protection. The Nader Art Gallery, considered the largest single collection of Haitian primitive art, a mecca for visitors who cherished The Nader Art Gallery, considered the largest single collection of Haitian primitive art, a mecca for visitors who cherished its paintings and metal sculptures's paintings and metal sculptures, collapsed. The Nader family escaped, but a maid was killed. the site looks like an archaeological dig, a mound of disaster covered in shards of ceramics and broken picture frames. At the Monnin Gallery, a prominent center in the affluent suburb of Petionville, shellshocked artists streamed in Saturday to reconnect with patrons and be reminded that life would go on. In the Monnin Gallery, a prominent center in the affluent suburb of Petionville, paintings on the wall were askew, the force of the Jan. 12 earthquake having turned paintings on the wall counterclockwise as paintings on the wall hung. A collection of Bizango statues, representing the enforcers of the high priests of voodoo and made with real human skulls, had fallen to the ground. Mireille Delice is a well-known creator of the “flags,” or banners, a form of Haitian art that is a piece of cloth, usually satin, decorated with beads or sequins. In the Jan. 12 earthquake Mireille Delice lost Mireille Delice's sister, Mireille Delice's house and Mireille Delice's box of sequins. “We have to keep on,” Mireille Delice said, seated at the Monnin Gallery, a prominent center in the affluent suburb of Petionville with other artists. Gabriel Coutard, a much sought-after painter, wandered in, in the same clothes Gabriel Coutard, a much sought-after painter has been wearing since the Jan. 12 earthquake. Gabriel Coutard, a much sought-after painter seemed, still, stunned, unable to finish sentences. Inevitably, art has caught up to reality. Frantz Zephirin, whose work graces the cover of this week’s New Yorker, has already incorporated the Jan. 12 earthquake in Frantz Zephirin, whose work graces the cover of this week’s New Yorker's art. Frantz Zephirin, whose work graces the cover of this week’s New Yorker ambled into the Monnin Gallery, a prominent center in the affluent suburb of Petionville, Frantz Zephirin, whose work graces the cover of this week’s New Yorker's newest creation tucked under Frantz Zephirin, whose work graces the cover of this week’s New Yorker's arm. his newest creation is a swirl of blue and green, with lots of eyeballs peering from the canvas, and a collection of outstretched hands reaching for help.
WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The World Bank said on Tuesday The World Bank was ready to send a team to Haiti to assess the extent of damage caused by the earthquake and begin working on plans for rebuilding Haiti. The World Bank said The World Bank was also ready to mobilize aid to Haiti but did not elaborate on how much The World Bank could make available. The World Bank said The World Bank's offices in a suburb of the capital Port-au-Prince were destroyed by the earthquake and most bank employees were accounted for.
Citigroup Inc said on Sunday Citigroup Inc had resumed operations in Haiti, but has relocated operations after a massive earthquake on January 12 damaged Citigroup Inc's main building and killed five employees. Citi, which has been in Haiti since 1971, said Citigroup Inc will serve corporate customers out of the ScotiaBank Building in Petion-Ville. Citigroup Inc said on Jan 13 that Citigroup Inc's three-story main building in Port-au-Prince had suffered extensive damage. a massive earthquake on January 12 was the most powerful earthquake to affect Haiti in more than a century.
Un barrage formé par l'affaissement d'un pan de montagne lors du tremblement de terre pourrait céder pendant la saison des pluies et causer beaucoup de dégâts à Grand-Goâve. Haïti croyait avoir tout vu en matière de catastrophes, mais voici qu'une nouvelle menace plane sur à Grand-Goâve: un barrage formé dans les montagnes par le tremblement de terre pourrait emporter davantage de vies et d'habitations s'il venait à céder. Yves Gattereau saute d'un rocher et pique une tête dans l'eau turquoise qui s'étend devant lui. Le paysage est montagneux et sauvage. Le silence est total. Si la scène semble idyllique, elle est loin de l'être. Le lac dans lequel Yves Gattereau vient de plonger ne devrait pas exister. Il s'est formé quand un pan de montagne s'est affaissé lors du tremblement de terre, bloquant le cours de la rivière Grand-Goâve. Yves Gattereau est un ingénieur forestier québécois installé en Haïti croyait depuis 22 ans. Celui qui dirige une équipe d'intervention sur les bassins versants pour Oxfam-Québec est inquiet. Il montre le mur de roc contre lequel l'eau s'accumule depuis un mois. La situation ne semble pas critique pour l'instant. Le barrage est énorme et il reste plusieurs dizaines de mètres avant que l'eau ne passe par-dessus. Le hic, c'est qu'il n'a pratiquement pas plu depuis le tremblement de terre du 12 janvier. Quand la saison des pluies se déclenchera, d'ici quelques semaines tout au plus, l'eau s'accumulera ici très rapidement. Que se passera-t-il si le barrage cède? Yves Gattereau admet qu'il ne peut le dire avec certitude. Mais il rappelle la topographie du terrain pour nous faire comprendre les risques. Dire que celle-ci n'est pas prête pour une nouvelle catastrophe est un euphémisme. Davantage une commune dispersée qu'une ville, Grand-Goâve compte quelque 110 000 habitants et a été détruite à 90% par le tremblement de terre. ici, la population vit dans des abris faits de bouts de bois sur lesquels on a tendu des draps et des morceaux de carton. Les tentes qu'on voit à Port-au-Prince ne sont pas arrivées ici; même les bâches de plastique sont rarissimes. C'est en examinant des images satellites du logiciel Google Earth Yves Gattereau a découvert Le barrage. Sa formation lui a permis de détecter le problème, mais il n'a pas l'expertise pour le régler. Depuis, il ne sait pas quoi faire. «Ce n'est pas encore urgent. Je ne voulais pas alerter la population et créer une panique supplémentaire», dit-il. Il a finalement décidé de joindre La Presse pour qu'elle diffuse l'information. L'armée américaine a aussi eu vent de la situation. Vendredi dernier, qu'elle a envoyé une équipe sur place. «On pourrait probablement faire Le barrage, mais nous n'avons aucune idée des conséquences que cela aurait», a dit à La Presse Jason Mangone, premier lieutenant de la marine américaine. Il a fait une demande pour qu'un expert en dynamique des fluides vienne sur les lieux. Il souligne que l'accès difficile au barrage compliquera les choses. L'endroit se gagne en effet au prix d'une éprouvante expédition qui débute par une randonnée de moto dans l'immense lit quasi asséché de la rivière Grand-Goâve. Les motos restent régulièrement prises dans le sable, les rochers ou l'eau. Il faut ensuite marcher dans la rivière Grand-Goâve, parfois avec de l'eau jusqu'à la taille, et contourner certaines zones impraticables en grimpant les parois. En chemin, l'équipe d'Yves Gattereau qu'a accompagnée La Presse a croisé deux militaires de la marine américaine qui rebroussaient chemin. «Je suis trop vieux pour ce genre de choses. On va essayer d'envoyer un hélicoptère», a lancé l'un des deux hommes, Steve Krutke.
Sixteen hours after the lynched thief was thrown onto a Port-au-Prince rubbish dump and set alight, the body of the lynched thief was still smouldering – a macabre glimpse of the sporadic violence that is flaring up in Port-au-Prince. With water, food and shelter in short supply for hundreds of thousands of earthquake survivors, localised flashpoints of looting and vigilante action to punish the perpetrators have arisen across Port-au-Prince. Haitian police were also reported to have shot dead at least one looter. Incongruously, the lynched thief's last resting place lay between two institutions of peace and culture. On one side of the street in which the lynched thief lay was a church, on the other an art gallery, the Musart Beau Decor. the body of the lynched thief had been burned to a cinder but you could see the remnants of a tyre that had been lain on or around the lynched thief as part of the living funeral pyre of rubbish that had been created for the lynched thief by the lynch mob. the lynched thief — made the fatal error of trying to the robbery fruit juice from a nearby street vendor in Petionville, a neighbourhood of Port-au-Prince where there is a relatively active police presence. By some accounts, the lynched thief pulled out a gun and shot a nearby street vendor in the head as the lynched thief was making the robbery. Police were close at hand — Police's headquarters are just a few blocks away — and the lynched thief was apprehended. What happened next is unclear. But the end result is certain: the lynched thief was frogmarched by about 12 men, beaten, thrown on the street, covered with a pyre of rubbish, and burned. Antoine Miguel, a resident who was among a group assembled around the body of the lynched thief, said that it was suspected the lynched thief was one of 3,000 inmates who broke out of the National Penitentiary in Port-au-Prince after earthquake unexpectedly granted 3,000 inmates who broke out of the National Penitentiary in the city after the earthquake unexpectedly granted them freedom freedom. earthquake released a few prisoners, who in turn overpowered the guards and opened all the cells, pouring on to the streets several of the most dangerous gang leaders who had previously terrorised parts of Port-au-Prince. Reuters reporters gained access to the inside of the National Penitentiary in the city where Reuters reporters found that on the inmates's way out the inmates had burned most of the prison records, making the job of tracking the inmates down and bringing the inmates back to jail all the more difficult. The prison breakout has spread fear, particularly in Cite Soleil, a poor neighbourhood with a notorious history of gang violence that had begun to become more peaceful under the interventions of Haitian president Rene Prevail. Now Cite Soleil, a poor neighbourhood with a notorious history of gang violence that had begun to become more peaceful under the interventions of Haitian president Rene Prevail is braced for a return of the gangs. "the gangs got out of prison and now the gangs're going around trying to rob people," said Cite Soleil, a poor neighbourhood with a notorious history of gang violence that had begun to become more peaceful under the interventions of Haitian president Rene Prevail resident Elgin St Louis, 34, told Reuters. "Last night the gangs spent the whole night shooting," Cite Soleil resident Elgin St Louis, 34, added. "We dread the gangs's return," said another. So far, warnings that Port-au-Prince would descend into anarchy have not materialised. Lawlessness has been localised and confined largely to the night. But the few incidents have been brutal. In the Delmar neighbourhood, two suspected looters were tied together and beaten before being dragged through the streets.
JUAN GONZALEZ: Amy Goodman is in Haiti, and we’ll be joining Amy Goodman in a few minutes. But first, we turn to a voice from one hospital in Port-au-Prince that was badly destroyed by last week’s earthquake. one hospital in Port-au-Prince that was badly destroyed by last week’s earthquake is three blocks from the crumbling National Palace. Former President Bill Clinton visited one hospital in Port-au-Prince that was badly destroyed by last week’s earthquake Monday, as hundreds of people with broken limbs and multiple fractures were waiting for medical supplies to arrive. Democracy Now! reached Dr. Evan Lyon at one hospital in Port-au-Prince that was badly destroyed by last week’s earthquake Monday evening. Dr. Evan Lyon is a doctor with Partners in Health. DR. EVAN LYON: We’ve been working around the clock since our team from Partners in Health came to meet up with our Haitian colleagues, who are still here and still leading and still helping us recover to try to get one hospital in Port-au-Prince that was badly destroyed by last week’s earthquake back up and running. The infrastructure is really, you know, completely destroyed. There is a nursing school on this campus that collapsed completely, killing really, as far as we know now, the entire class of second-year nursing students. The medical school right behind Dr. Evan Lyon is — will not ever be usable again. But the main problem is that this General Hospital, the main general public hospital for Port-au-Prince, is still barely operational. We have a thousand patients scattered throughout this campus, mostly sleeping under the stars or sleeping in tents, a thousand patients who have been triaged, assessed. a thousand patients who have been triaged, assessed’re getting primary care. a thousand patients who have been triaged, assessed’re getting good medical care from Haitian staff and from volunteer international relief staff. But we are just scratching the surface of the operative needs of the orthopedic and other operative needs. Again, 1,000 people in need of operations, and we’re just barely starting to scratch the surface of the operative needs of the orthopedic and other operative needs. Two days ago, we began operating. We had four operating rooms up as quick as possible and have been using four operating rooms ever since. We don’t have full proper anesthesia. We’re missing many of the materials we need. But that has been working. As of last night, we have some electricity on this campus, and we’ll be able to start operating twenty-four hours a day through last night and on through tomorrow. Dr. Evan Lyon think, you know, the singing and the [inaudible], Dr. Evan Lyon know, is clear to many, certainly anyone who has followed Haiti and cared about this special country. One thing that Dr. Evan Lyon think is really important for people to understand is that misinformation and rumors and, Dr. Evan Lyon think at the bottom of the issue, racism has slowed the recovery efforts of one hospital in Port-au-Prince that was badly destroyed by last week’s earthquake. Security issues over the last forty-eight hours have been our — quote “security issues” over the last forty-eight hours have been our leading concern. And there are no security issues. Dr. Evan Lyon’ve been with Dr. Evan Lyon's Haitian colleagues. Dr. Evan Lyon’m staying at a friend’s house in Port-au-Prince. We’re working for the Ministry of Public Health for the direction of one hospital in Port-au-Prince that was badly destroyed by last week’s earthquake as volunteers. But Dr. Evan Lyon’m living and moving with friends. We’ve been circulating throughout Port-au-Prince until 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning every night, evacuating patients, moving materials. There’s no UN guards. There’s no US military presence. There’s no Haitian police presence. And there’s also no violence. There is no insecurity.
Such concerns evoke little sympathy from the people waiting for aid. "the Rev Paul Frantz Cole understand these people are worried about the risks of bringing aid to us, you cannot save us if you cannot save yourself," said the Rev Paul Frantz Cole as the Rev Paul Frantz Cole finished taking morning service at the Rev Paul Frantz Cole's Anglican church in the Carrefour district.
Remenión, jamaquión, temblor, sismo, juidero, panico, corre corre. Ayer martes 12 de Enero cinco minutos antes de las seis, la isla volvió a recordarnos que se mueve, que no es un pedazo de tierra estático, que sus placas no son como las de los carros y que el suelo no pide permisos para sus sacudidas instantáneas. Shakes, a quake, tremors, earthquake, panic, call it what you wish. Yesterday, on Tuesday, January 12, at 5 minutes to 6 pm, the island once again reminded us that the island moves, that the island is not a piece of static earth, that the island's plates are not like those of cars and that the ground does not ask for permission for instantaneous shakes. the island's capital, Port-au-Prince located 10 miles east of the earthquake's epicenter, was left devastated and incommunicado. Buildings had collapsed, and left countless thousands injured or dead, as there are no official numbers. Without electricity, water, or communication, several hours passed before the entire world could witness the damage caused by the earthquake's. Many of these photographs and testimonies were distributed via social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. The scene was grim, and to make matters worse, the aftershocks did not let up. In the island, as a result of the earthquake's, a tsunami alert was placed in effect, and the Emergency Operations Commission (COE) closed the commercial plazas in the capital Santo Domingo and took precautions along the coastal zones and on the Haitian border. In the early morning hours of the next day, Dominican President Leonel Fernández called an emergency meeting to put together a aid commission for the island, which included aid for health, water, electricity, infrastructure, and the assistance of the military. Desde tempranas horas de hoy, las autoridades, empresariado y militares dominicanos unen sus fuerzas para movilizar ayuda humanitaria ante el temblor de the island. From the early morning hours today [Wednesday, January 13] the authorities, businesses, and the Dominican military joined forces to mobilize humanitarian help for the the island earthquake. The Dominican team help send food and bottled water, and sent heavy machinery to help remove the rubble. The hospitals in the province of Barahona were made available, as well as the airport to receive aid that would be distributed to the island. Personnel from the COE attended to more than 2,000 injured and the Dominican Institute of Telecommunications (Indotel) helped to restore telephony services. The Dominican Red Cross and the International Red Cross have been coordinating health relief services. the island has also been a landing point for foreign correspondents who have come to cover the earthquake's. In addition to the efforts of the island, many Dominicans have joined the cause with collection centers, while others have offered private plnes and other materials destine for the island. Duarte 101 [es] writes a short summary of the help needed and collection points across the island. El pueblo dominicano se ha volcado para ayudar a the island. Lo que ha ocurrido en the island no tiene precedente. Es demasiado dolor. Demasiado sufrimiento. Aquí se paran las diferencias absurdas y se impone la solidaridad pura y simple. Abierta y decidida. Es este el justo momento para ayudar a un pueblo hermano. Démosle la mano y el alma a un pueblo que no merece tanto sufrimiento. The Dominican people have bent over backwards to help the island. What happened in the island has no precedent. There is too much pain. Too much suffering. The absurd differences stop here and solidarity is imposed, pure and simple, openly and decidedly. This is the right moment to help our brother nation. Let's give our hand and our soul to a people that do not deserve so much suffering.
El Gobierno de República Dominicana anunció este miércoles que en las próximas horas saldrá un avión a Haití con personal especializado que colaborará con el rescate de las víctimas atrapadas en los escombros que dejó el terremoto de 7,3 grados en la escala de Ritcher que golpeó este martes a esa nación caribeña. El responsable de prensa del palacio presidencial, Rafael Núñez, informó a la prensa de que enviarán a Puerto Príncipe médicos, medicinas, alimentos, personal de rescate y perros amaestrados, y anunció que dispondrán de más ayuda humanitaria una vez que se tenga un balance de los daños ocasionados por el terremoto. El Ministerio de Salud Pública, por su parte, enviará ocho Clínicas Móviles con una flota de 36 médicos con especialidades en Ortopedia, Traumatología, Anestesiólogos, y Cirujanos, una gran cantidad de Vacunas y Medicamentos. El Gobierno de Fernández también ha hecho un llamamiento a la comunidad internacional para que acuda en ayuda de Haití donde se estima que miles de personas han quedado atrapadas bajo los escombros de los edificios y casas que se derrumbaron tras el fuerte seísmo. "Haití, lamentablemente no está en condiciones de hacer frente a ese tipo de eventualidades, por lo que nosotros como Gobierno hacemos un llamado a la comunidad internacional para que envíe brigadas de socorro para este tipo de eventos", expresó Núñez. Los primeros aviones de la Fuerza Aérea Dominicana saldrán en horas saldrá de la mañana (tarde en España) a Puerto Príncipe, según las instrucciones dadas por Fernández al Ejército dominicano. Las autoridades dominicanas informaron además del envío de 39 camiones de alimentos enlatados, 10 cocinas móviles y 110 cocineros que llegaron este miércoles en la madrugada al país vecino para producir 100.000 raciones diarias de comida. El Instituto Dominicano de Telecomunicaciones anunció además el envío de brigadas de técnicos especializados de la Empresa Viva para ayudar en el restablecimiento de las comunicaciones en Haití. El Centro de Operaciones de Emergencias (COE) levantó este miércoles la alerta roja decretada en 17 provincias de República Dominica al determinar que "las condiciones para que se genere un Tsunami en el país se han reducido significativamente". República Dominica decretó este martes la alerta máxima en varias provincias ante la posibilidad de que se produjera un tsunami por el terremoto que tuvo lugar en Haití y que afectó, no sólo territorio dominicano, sino también parte del este de Cuba. Las provincias en las que se había decretado la alerta máxima son La Altagracia, La Romana, San Pedro de Macorís, Distrito Nacional, San Cristóbal, Azua, Barahona, Santo Domingo, Peravia, Pedernales, Montecristi, Puerto Plata, Maria Trinidad Sánchez, Samaná, Hato Mayor, El Seibo y Espaillat (Gaspar Hernández y Cabarete).
החל הבריחה המונית מפורט א-פרנס שבהאיטי: אלפים מתושבי הבירה החלו אחר הצהרים (שבת) לנהור מחוץ לעיר שחלקים רבים ממנה נהרסו כתוצאה מרעידת האדמה הקשה בשבוע שעבר. זאת בשל הקצב האיטי של זרימת האספקה לפצועים, הפליטים והרעבים. רבים מהם מבקשים להגיע לאזור הכפרי, שנפגע פחות מרעש האדמה, בחיפוש אחר מקלט אצל חברים וקרובי משפחה, כשמיטלטליהן בידיהם. אחרים העמיסו את כלי הרכב שלהם וברחו מהעיר, ממתינים במשך שעות בתחנות הדלק לתדלק את רכביהם. "חיכיתי במשך יומיים אבל שום דבר לא הגיע, אפילו לא בקבוק מים", אמר יוואס מאנוס כשהוא צועד עם אשתו ושתי ילדיו ברחוב הראשי בעיר. "אמרו לנו שישנן משאיות שמעמיסות אנשים מחוץ לגיהינום הזה", אמרה אשתו של מאנוס. "איבדתי את כל כספי, אבל אני אתן את הבגדים שלי, אתן את הכול כדי לצאת מכאן", הוסיפה. נשיא ארה"ב ברק אובמה מינה מוקדם יותר היום את הנשיאים לשעבר ביל קלינטון וג'ורג' בוש הבן כשליחים מיוחדים של הממשל האמריקאי לגיוס כספים לסיוע בשיקום האסון בהאיטי.

There has recently been a flurry of activity in the Open Street Map community to improve maps of Haiti to assist humanitarian aid organisations responding to the recent earthquake. In particular mappers and developers are scouring satellite images to identify collapsed and damaged buildings/bridges, spontaneous refugee camps, landslides, blocked roads and other damaged infrastructure – to help NGOs and international organisations respond more effectively to the crisis. On January 12 2010, the recent earthquake struck Port-au-Prince. the Open Street Map community can help the response by tracing Yahoo imagery and other data sources, and collecting existing data sets below. If you have connections with expat Haitian communities, consider getting in touch to work with expat Haitian communities to enter place names, etc. On Wednesday Mikel Maron wrote to the OSM talk list asking for help. Yesterday several companies authorised the Open Street Map community to use several companies's images. Recently generated data from Open Street Map has been used in maps by ITHACA (Information Technology for Humanitarian Assistance, Cooperation and Action) and the World Food Programme. Yesterday evening Mikel Maron reported there had been over 400 edits since the recent earthquake. At the time of writing it looks like over 400 edits since the earthquake has now more than doubled to over 800 edits since 12th January.
In Miami's "Little Haiti" neighborhood, waves of shock and grief continue to roll over community members. As the extent of devastation in people's homeland becomes clear, people are trying to figure out how to get information from the earthquake zone and cope with people's losses. A communications blackout continued Thursday and many in Miami's "Little Haiti" neighborhood remained frantic about the fate of friends and relatives. Thursday morning, shopkeeper Francesca Jean clutched a cell phone held together with duct tape. shopkeeper Francesca Jean had pressed "redial" too many times. "Since yesterday shopkeeper Francesca Jean've been trying to get in contact with their homeland and shopkeeper Francesca Jean'm trying to call shopkeeper Francesca Jean's mom and shopkeeper Francesca Jean's brother to see if my mom and my brother're OK, but shopkeeper Francesca Jean don't have no signal or nothing," shopkeeper Francesca Jean says. The lack of communication with their homeland has become a tremendous logistical issue. Donations are coming in: 50,000 portable housing units from one source, generators from another, supplies of bottled water from a third. But Frantzy DeRose, director of the local Haitian-American alliance, says the need cannot be accurately measured. Hundreds gathered Wednesday night for a prayer service at Notre Dame d'Haiti Catholic Church in Miami's. At the beginning of a Creole song of mourning, attendees were restrained. But emotions gradually erupted and by the end of a Creole song of mourning people were wailing, some of people kneeling in tears with their hands in the air, or even rolling on the floor. Father Reginald Jean-Mary reminded people that their homeland has historically suffered misfortune followed by worldwide apathy. But Father Reginald Jean-Mary said Haitians are the children of God as much as anyone, and Haitians deserve common fairness. common fairness included, Father Reginald Jean-Mary said, TPS, or temporary protected status. Haitians have been seeking TPS, or temporary protected status for years. TPS, or temporary protected status allows people to live temporarily in the U.S. when people's own countries have become unsafe because of political upheaval or natural disaster. Many thought the catastrophe in their homeland would make it more likely for Haitians to gain TPS, or temporary protected status. But local leaders, like Marleine Bastien of the Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition, became infuriated today when the Obama administration stopped deportations of undocumented Haitians but made no mention of TPS, or temporary protected status. the catastrophe in Haiti is just the latest disaster to befall their homeland. In 2008, four hurricanes struck their homeland. Community activist Lucie Tondreau says their homeland recovered from four hurricanes. But just barely.
In pictures: Rescuers continue search Mass amputation fears How to manage a crisis US opens doors to Haiti orphans Battle against the looters Some buildings already weakened by last week's quake collapsed and wails of terror filled the air as frightened survivors poured out of unstable buildings, a BBC correspondent in the region said. Although some aid has started to reach desperate survivors, hundreds of thousands are still without food or water, a full week after last week's quake. Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) said Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders)'s cargo plane with 12 tonnes of medical supplies had been turned away from the congested Port-au-Prince airport three times since Sunday. Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) said five patients died from lack of the supplies its cargo plane with 12 tonnes of medical supplies carried. "Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) were forced to buy a saw in the market to continue amputations," Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders)'s Loris de Filippi told the Reuters news agency in Cite Soleil. But the US military has defended the US military's efforts in the face of vast logistical challenges. "the US military're doing everything in the US military's power to speed aid to Haiti as fast as humanly possible," said Gen Douglas Fraser, head of the US military. Gen Douglas Fraser, head of US Southern Command said the US military plan to start using two other airports, at Jacmel in Haiti and San Isidro in the neighbouring Dominican Republic, in the coming days. Amazing rescues One full week after last week's quake devastated Haiti, search-and-rescue teams were emerging from the ruins with unbelievable success stories. Ena Zizi, 69, was rescued from the wreckage of the residence of Haiti's Roman Catholic archbishop on Monday, a day before crews recovered the body of Haiti's Roman Catholic archbishop. Another survivor, 25-year-old Lozama Hotteline, was rescued from beneath a collapsed supermarket with the help of teams from Turkey and France. Television pictures showed Another survivor, 25-year-old Lozama Hotteline's smiling and singing as Another survivor, 25-year-old Lozama Hotteline was carried to safety. The United Nations said early on Wednesday that 121 people had been rescued by international teams since last week's quake - an extra 31 people on Tuesday. Aid challenges In a bid to speed up the delivery of aid and stem looting and violence, US troops have stepped up US troops's presence in Haiti. AT THE SCENE Mark Doyle, BBC, Port-au-Prince was extremely poor even before last week's quake, and last week's quake has now broken all the basic services, like phones and electricity. But Haitians are resilient. Everywhere there are volunteers filling some of the gaps created by the slow arrival of international aid. A company which sells drinking water is distributing drinking water free to people living in a school compound. A Haitian Jesuit priest has mobilised local relief workers and international doctors to work together in a rural region just outside Port-au-Prince. In a slum area, a volunteer first-aider dressed the wounds of a girl who had been trapped in rubble. These largely unsung heroes know These largely unsung heroes can't replace the big foreign aid agencies, but These largely unsung heroes're doing what These largely unsung heroes can to fill the gaps. US Black Hawk helicopters swooped down on the grounds of Haiti's wrecked presidential palace on Tuesday, dropping scores of US troops who moved to secure a nearby hospital and set up aid distribution points. US Army Maj Gen Daniel Allyn, the deputy commander for relief operations in Haiti, said the US military had delivered 400,000 bottles of water and 300,000 food rations since last week's's earthquake. US Army Maj Gen Daniel Allyn, the deputy commander for relief operations in Haiti said the number of US troops would grow to 10,000 in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the UN Security Council voted to temporarily boost the UN Security Council's peacekeeping forces by 3,500 personnel. The United Nations officials said UN officials would accompany US troops as US troops delivered supplies. While military escorts are still needed to deliver relief supplies, The United Nations said fears of violence and looting had eased. Improved security "The overall security situation in Port-au-Prince remains stable, with limited, localised violence and looting occurring," the The United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. So far, feared infectious diseases have not shown up, although many injured faced the immediate threats of tetanus and gangrene, and hospitals are overwhelmed. The United Nations says "localised looting" is occurring, but overall security is good The Pentagon said a navy hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, had received a navy hospital ship, the USNS Comfort's first Haitian patients, even as a navy hospital ship, the USNS Comfort was still heading towards Haiti. US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said the military is sending additional ships to help with earthquake recovery in Haiti, including one that could remove debris blocking the main port. The World Food Programme said The World Food Programme was planning to bring in 10,000 gallons (40,000 litres) of diesel a day from the neighbouring Dominican Republic as Haitian fuel supplies dried up. Haitian officials say the death toll from last week's quake was likely to be between 100,000 and 200,000, and that 75,000 bodies had already been buried in mass graves.
MIAMI (Reuters) - The U.S. military said on Sunday The U.S. military was doing The U.S. military's best to get as many planes as possible into Port-au-Prince, after NGOs complained shipments of aid had not been allowed to land at the U.S.-controlled airport. More than 30 countries have rushed relief to Haiti since Tuesday’s devastating earthquake, choking the airspace and the ramp at the U.S.-controlled airport and delaying the arrival of urgently needed medical and food supplies. Colonel Buck Elton, commander of The U.S. military directing flights at Haiti's airport, said there had been 600 take-offs and landings since Colonel Buck Elton, commander of the U.S. military directing flights at Haiti’s airport, took over the U.S.-controlled airport's traffic on Wednesday, though 50 flights had been diverted. the U.S.-controlled airport's control tower was knocked out by Tuesday’s devastating earthquake and U.S. military air controllers were operating from a radio post on the airfield grass, Colonel Buck Elton, commander of the U.S. military directing flights at Haiti’s airport, said. “What The U.S. military set up here would be similar to running a major airport ... without any communications, electricity or computers,” Colonel Buck Elton, commander of the U.S. military directing flights at Haiti’s airport, told reporters in a telephone briefing from Port-au-Prince. Medecins Sans Frontieres complained that a cargo plane carrying an inflatable surgical hospital was blocked from landing in Port-au-Prince on Saturday, and was rerouted to Samana, in the Dominican Republic, from where it would take 24 hours to get to Port-au-Prince by truck. “Priority must be given immediately to planes carrying lifesaving equipment and medical personnel,” Medecins Sans Frontieres said in a statement. Colonel Buck Elton, commander of the U.S. military directing flights at Haiti’s airport, said the flow of air traffic was improving, with only 3 of 67 incoming flights being rerouted on Saturday, and only two flights diverted on Sunday. The airport apron can only handle one wide-bodied plane and five narrow-bodied planes at a time, plus other aircraft that can be parked on the airfield grass. “The U.S. military's intent is as soon as one aircraft departs, another one arrives,” Colonel Buck Elton, commander of the U.S. military directing flights at Haiti’s airport, said.
Amid sporadic looting and pleas from local police for backup, the U.S. military said Monday that the bottleneck slowing aid distribution in Haiti's capital is easing, with more flights moving through Haiti's capital's airport and the seaport expected to reopen later this week. In addition, the U.S. military on Monday staged the first drop of supplies from a fixed aircraft. Flying nonstop from a base in North Carolina, a C-17 delivered 14,500 meals ready to eat and 15,000 liters of water to a drop zone five miles northeast of the Haiti's capital airport, the U.S. military said. Helicopters have been delivering supplies but Helicopters's loads are significantly smaller. Thirty three are now in the field, and will be joined by 15 more by Tuesday, the U.S. military said. U.S. officials also agreed with U.N. officials on a system to grant priority to humanitarian flights — following criticism that military and rescue flights had sometimes been first in line. Some countries and aid groups such as Geneva-based Doctors Without Borders had complained that planes filled with doctors and medical supplies had been forced to land in the neighboring Dominican Republic and come in by road, delaying urgent care for injured quake victims by two days. In Paris, French Cooperation Minister Alain Joyandet expressed concern about the major U.S. military role in Haiti's, saying the major U.S. military role in the country should be clarified: "the major U.S. military role in the country is about helping Haiti's, not about occupying Haiti's," said Joyandet, who last week complained about U.S. handling of the city's airport. But other French officials were conciliatory. French Cooperation Minister Alain Joyandet said it's still more important to repair the seaport — a task U.S. officials said U.S. officials hoped to achieve this week. "In terms of aid, the seaport's the port where we can bring most of the aid," French Cooperation Minister Alain Joyandet said. The U.S. Coast Guard ship Oak is at the seaport and will use heavy cranes and other equipment to make the seaport functional. Also Monday, some 2,200 U.S. Marines arrived by ship, some 2,200 U.S. Marines's mission to protect the huge relief operation. Police: Haiti's needs helpIt was not clear when some 2,200 U.S. Marines would leave some 2,200 U.S. Marines's ships for the destroyed streets of Haiti's capital, but local police pleaded for backup immediately. "We do not have the capacity to fix this situation. Haiti's needs help ... the Americans are welcome here. But where are the Americans? We need the Americans here on the street with us," said policeman Dorsainvil Robenson, as policeman Dorsainvil Robenson chased looters. "Whether things explode is all down to whether help gets through from the international community," added police commander Ralph Jean-Brice, who runs Haiti's's West Department. police commander Ralph Jean-Brice, who runs Haiti's West Department's police force is down by half due to quake. Looting spread to more parts of downtown Port-au-Prince on Monday as hundreds of young men and boys clambered up broken walls to break into shops to take whatever hundreds of young men and boys could find. Especially prized was toothpaste, which people smear under people's noses to fend off the stench of decaying bodies. At one place, youths fought over a stock of rum with broken bottles, machetes and razors and police fired shots into the air to break up youths. "Jean-Pierre Junior am drinking as much as Jean-Pierre Junior can. It gives courage," said Jean-Pierre Junior, wielding a broken wooden plank with nails to protect Jean-Pierre Junior's bottle of rum. some 2,200 U.S. Marines are arriving with heavy earth-moving equipment, medical aid and helicopters, said the U.S. Southern Command, which aims to have more than 10,000 U.S. troops in the area for the rescue operation. Some 1,000 U.S. troops were already on the ground Monday morning, most of Some 1,000 U.S. troops Army soldiers from the 82nd Airborne. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Monday asked the Security Council to beef up the the United Nations peacekeeping force in Haiti's with 1,500 additional police and 2,000 troops. the United Nations now has about 7,000 troops and 2,100 police in Haiti's. A decision was expected Tuesday. World leaders have promised massive amounts of assistance to rebuild Haiti's since Tuesday's quake killed as many as 200,000 people and left Haiti's's capital, Port-au-Prince, in ruins. European Union institutions and member states have offered more than $575 million in emergency and longer-term assistance to Haiti's. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, the the United Nations special envoy to Haiti's, arrived Monday in Haiti's capital, bringing aid supplies and being briefed on Haiti's's needs. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, the U.N. special envoy to Haiti, was due to meet with Haitian President Rene Preval, whose cabinet met outside police headquarters on Sunday in a circle of white plastic chairs due to the collapse of the presidential palace. Streets piled with debris slowed the delivery of medical and food supplies, but there were signs of progress as international medical teams took over damaged hospitals where seriously injured people had lain untreated for days. A few signs of normality returned as street sellers emerged with fruit and vegetables, but gangs of looters still prowled demolished streets of downtown Port-au-Prince. In downtown Port-au-Prince on Sunday, Haitian riot police fired tear gas to disperse looters as several nearby shops burned. With people turning more desperate by Sunday, looters are even fighting each other with knives, hammers, ice picks and rocks. In some cases, neighbors have become vigilantes. At least two suspected looters were shot dead on Sunday, witnesses said. Moreover, heavily armed gang members have returned to the Cite Soleil shantytown since breaking out from prison after quake. American officials are concerned about security in Haiti's but consider security in earthquake-stricken Haiti manageable, the U.S. ambassador to Haiti's said in an interview. "security in earthquake-stricken Haiti is obviously not perfect," the U.S. ambassador to Haiti told TODAY when asked about the potential for violence among people desperate for food, water and shelter. the U.S. ambassador to Haiti called the U.S. military presence in and around Haiti's a backup option in the event of violence, saying first call would be the Haitian police force and the U.N. force in Haiti's. the U.S. ambassador to Haiti credited Brazilians in the U.N. force in Haiti with making a strong contribution toward stability.
A Canadian soldier carries supplies as troops arrive at a medical centre in Port-au-Prince. Canada's DART forces will focus efforts on the port town of Jacmel. Canada's's disaster response team in Haiti will focus Canada's disaster response team in Haiti's aid efforts for Haiti on the port town of Jacmel, Brig.-Gen. Guy Laroche says. Laroche, speaking from Port-au-Prince alongside Canada's's ambassador to Haiti, Gilles Rivard, said Canada's disaster response team in Haiti has been asked by Haiti to focus on the town that lies about 30 kilometres southwest of Port-au-Prince. How to help To help those affected by the earthquake, here is a list of organizations accepting donations. Laroche, speaking from Port-au-Prince alongside Canada's ambassador to Haiti, Gilles Rivard, said Laroche, speaking from Port-au-Prince alongside Canada's ambassador to Haiti, Gilles Rivard, travelled with Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive to see the damage in the port town of Jacmel — and saw that the hospital was half destroyed by the earthquake. The road into the port town of Jacmel has been cut off from the rest of Haiti since the earthquake, making delivery of aid difficult. Canadian ships HMCS Athabaskan and HMCS Halifax, loaded with relief supplies, were just north of Haiti early Monday. Laroche, speaking from Port-au-Prince alongside Canada's ambassador to Haiti, Gilles Rivard, said that while HMCS Athabaskan will move to west of Port-au-Prince, HMCS Halifax is bound for the port town of Jacmel. Defence Minister Peter MacKay had earlier said the region faces other logistical challenges. The airport, little more than a runway, is capable of landing a Hercules aircraft but not the larger CC-177 transports, Defence Minister Peter MacKay said. the port town of Jacmel's port, while not unusable, is still not equipped to handle a ship the size of the two Canadian vessels arriving Monday, meaning supplies and personnel would have to be ferried from the two Canadian vessels arriving Monday to The town's port, Defence Minister Peter MacKay said. the port town of Jacmel is also the hometown of the father of Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive. As Canadian forces arrive in Haiti to provide more aid, Canada's ambassador to Haiti, Gilles Rivard said the process to get Canadians and Canadians's families out of Haiti has been complicated by crowds forming outside the embassy. On Saturday, Immigration Canada said Immigration Canada will expedite immigration applications from Haiti with family in Haiti, while Haitians in Haiti temporarily will also be allowed to extend Haitians in Canada temporarily's stay. But Canada's ambassador to Haiti, Gilles Rivard said erroneous Haitian media reports circulated that said any Haitian citizen could obtain a visa to Haiti by showing up at the embassy. erroneous Haitian media reports circulated that said any Haitian citizen could obtain a visa to Canada by showing up at the embassy led to aggressive crowds forming outside the embassy on Sunday, and has slowed the process of determining immigration claims. "Canada's ambassador to Haiti, Gilles Rivard would say 90 per cent of the people that are here are here based on erroneous Haitian media reports circulated that said any Haitian citizen could obtain a visa to Canada by showing up at the embassy and not because 90 per cent of the people that are here have a status of permanent resident or are close to getting a status of permanent resident," Canada's ambassador to Haiti, Gilles Rivard said.
Anthony Thomas The team found large areas of Leogane had been reduced to a landscape of rubble and twisted metal. Before the quake, more than 100,000 people lived there. "The team were obviously the first team in there," Anthony Thomas said. "The team's job is to try and get people out from under the smashed buildings, but there was nobody to rescue. "There were dead bodies piled up by the roads. The people left are absolutely desperate for medical help." Anthony Thomas is working in The team. Anthony Thomas said: "This is Anthony Thomas's fifth mission to a disaster zone and, as tragic as it is, you do get used to the death." Anthony Thomas said the chances of finding anyone else alive in the rubble were dwindling as time passed. The leading US general in Haiti Lt Gen Ken Keen has said it is a "reasonable assumption" that up to 200,000 people could have died in the quake. The leading US general in Haiti Lt Gen Ken Keen said the quake was of "epic proportions", but it was too early to know the full human cost.

BBC Caribbean The 20-minute long daily broadcast, called Connexion Haiti, will try to give people up-to-date information about the basic services people need to survive - such as where to find food, clean drinking water, medical assistance and shelter. An estimated 1.5 million people were left homeless by the 7.0-magnitude quake, which some have estimated has killed as many as 200,000 people. The UN says 130,000 people have now been relocated out of Port-au-Prince, easing the pressure on overcrowded camps in Port-au-Prince. Meanwhile the The UN agency the World Food Programme says the UN agency the World Food Programme has increased the UN agency the World Food Programme's food aid to survivors. Speaking after a two-day evaluation mission to Port-au-Prince, the executive director of the UN agency the World Food Programme, Josette Sheeran, said that on Friday the UN agency the World Food Programme had delivered about 2 million meals. "This is the most complex operation the UN agency the World Food Programme has ever launched," the executive director of WFP, Josette Sheeran said. "Haiti's entire supply chain infrastructure has been devastated, and the UN agency the World Food Programme have been faced with launching an operation from scratch." A benefit concert featuring more than 100 music and Hollywood stars has been broadcast around the world to raise money for the victims of the 7.0-magnitude quake, which some have estimated has killed as many as 200,000 people.
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Ten American missionaries were charged Thursday in Haiti with child abduction and criminal conspiracy, but should not be sent for trial in the United States, officials said. Ten American missionaries were detained on Friday after trying to drive a bus-load of 33 children over the border into the United States. Ten American missionaries were formally charged with “kidnapping minors and criminal association” on Thursday according to Ten American missionaries's lawyer Edwin Coq. Ten American missionaries could now face nine years in prison on child kidnapping charges and further jail time for conspiracy. Ten American missionaries has denied any ill intentions, saying Ten American missionaries were merely trying to help children orphaned and abandoned by the January 12 quake. But amid continued chaos in PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, the head of Port-au-Prince lawyers’ association, Gervais Charles, said any trial would be impossible in the United States any time soon. “It is absolutely impossible to carry out the trial for Ten American missionaries in Haiti right now. Judicial proceedings have not officially restarted in PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti,” the head of Port-au-Prince lawyers’ association, Gervais Charles said. Earlier government prosecutor Mazan Fortil said it was not yet clear if Ten American missionaries could be tried in Haiti. “We cannot say right now. We have to apply Haitian law. The case will be sent before a judicial panel, to open the investigation,” Earlier government prosecutor Mazan Fortil said.
