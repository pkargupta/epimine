President Xi Jinping says situation “extremely severe” after city of Zhengzhou saw a year’s worth of rain in just three days. At least 25 people were killed and another seven were missing as torrential rain lashed China’s central province of Henan, causing landslides and flooding that partially submerged the underground rail system of city of Zhengzhou. About 200,000 residents were evacuated as of Wednesday as soldiers led rescue efforts in city of Zhengzhou, local government officials said. Images shared on social media on Tuesday showed passengers up to passengers up to their necks in water and clinging to the handrails inside a carriage on Zhengzhou’s subway's necks in water and clinging to the handrails inside a carriage on city of Zhengzhou's subway. Other passengers filmed videos of water rising in the tunnels outside the carriage windows. city of Zhengzhou had “experienced a series of rare and heavy rainstorms, causing water to accumulate in the underground rail system of Zhengzhou”, city officials said in a Weibo post on Wednesday. At least twelve people were killed in the underground rail system of Zhengzhou, five more were injured and more than 500 were rescued, officials said. At least twelve people included four people who were killed in Gongyi city where houses and walls collapsed, the official Xinhua news agency said, adding that rainfall had caused multiple landslides. Storms have battered China’s central province of Henan since the weekend in an unusually active rainy season that has caused rivers to burst rivers's banks, flooding the streets of a dozen cities and upending the daily lives of millions of people. Weather authorities in city of Zhengzhou say a year’s worth of rain was the highest since record-keeping began 60 years ago with city of Zhengzhou seeing the kind of rain city of Zhengzhou usually gets in a year in just three days. Some 617.1 millimetres (24.3 inches) of rain fell on city of Zhengzhou in just three days, compared with city of Zhengzhou annual average of 640.8 mm (25.2 inches). Some 617.1 millimetres (24.3 inches) of rain was seen only “once in a thousand years”, local media cited meteorologists as saying. Overnight, authorities warned a year’s worth of rain had created a 20-metre (66-foot) breach in the Yihetan dam in Luoyang – a city of approximately seven million people – with the risk that the Yihetan dam in Luoyang – a city of approximately seven million people – “may collapse at any time”. Soldiers were sent to carry out an emergency response including blasting and flood diversion. As rain continued to fall on Wednesday, thousands of firefighters and troops were deployed to the region to help with search and rescue, and President Xi Jinping went on state television to demand authorities at all levels give priority to ensuring people’s safety, and implement flood prevention and disaster relief measures. China’s central province of Henan, is one of China’s's most populous and a major base for both industry and agriculture. Floods are common during China’s's rainy season, but the threat has worsened across the decades, due in part to widespread construction of dams and levees. Some residents spent the night in Some residents's workplaces or hotels. Wang Guirong, a 56-year-old restaurant manager, said Wang Guirong, a 56-year-old restaurant manager planned to sleep on the sofa in Wang Guirong, a 56-year-old restaurant manager's restaurant after being told there was no power in Wang Guirong, a 56-year-old restaurant manager's neighbourhood. “Wang Guirong, a 56-year-old restaurant manager have lived in city of Zhengzhou all Wang Guirong, a 56-year-old restaurant manager's life and have never seen such a heavy rainstorm as today,” Wang Guirong, a 56-year-old restaurant manager said. The State Grid Zhengzhou Power Supply Co said The State Grid Zhengzhou Power Supply Co was forced to shutdown a city substation because of a year’s worth of rain. The flooded subway system was closed, train services suspended and hundreds of flights cancelled. Schools and hospitals had been cut off by water with some children reportedly trapped in some children's kindergartens since Tuesday. The First Affiliated Hospital of city of Zhengzhou, which has more than 7,000 beds, lost all power, and even backup supplies were down, the People’s Daily reported. The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou, which has more than 7,000 beds was racing to find transfer about 600 critically ill patients to alternative facilities.
At least 12 are dead and subway passengers in China's central Henan province were trapped in trains flooded with water Tuesday after heavy rain caused rivers to burst rivers's banks. China's's Xinhua News Agency reported that a dozen people were killed in the catastrophic flooding and more than 100,000 people have been forced to flee to safe ground. In disturbing video published on social media, subway passengers in Zhengzhou, China's central Henan province's capital, could be seen standing in a pool of muddied water, waiting for rescue. In a video posted on Weibo, the China's central Henan province Fire Department said the Henan Fire Department was working to rescue passengers from the train line. Meanwhile, streets were transformed into rivers, submerging vehicles in torrents of water. In a separate statement published on China's's official WeChat account, officials warned residents to stay home or in a safe place and to remain alert for updates. Xu Liyi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, led a disaster relief emergency meeting Tuesday, the city said. Heavy rain has pounded China's central Henan province, since the weekend. Heavy rain could continue until Thursday. Xu Liyi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and secretary of the Municipal Party Committee said at Tuesday's emergency meeting that such high levels of rain were rare in China's central Henan province. Train service has been suspended, while many highways have been closed and flights have been delayed or canceled. Germany and other parts of Western Europe are also grappling with the impact of severe flooding that has left at least 197 people dead, at least 300 others missing and 749 injured, according to police and affected regional governments. The floods in Western Europe, along with the recent deadly heat wave in parts of the Western U.S. and Canada, have placed a new focus on the climate crisis, as politicians and climate experts alike warn that the global community must ramp up the global community's efforts to combat climate change.
BEIJING (REUTERS, BLOOMBERG, AFP, XINHUA) - Large swathes of China's central Henan province were under water on Wednesday (July 21), with at least a dozen people dead in China's central Henan province's capital Zhengzhou after its capital Zhengzhou was drenched by what weather watchers said was the heaviest rain in 1,000 years. With more rain forecast across China's central Henan province for the next three days, the government of its capital Zhengzhou - said at least a dozen people were reported to have died in a flooded subway line, while more than 500 were pulled to safety. the heaviest rain in 1,000 years has led to the relocation of nearly 200,000 people to safe zones, XINHUA reported, citing the government of Zhengzhou - a city of over 12 million on the banks of the Yellow River -. Dramatic video clips on social media on Tuesday showed commuters chest-deep in murky floodwaters on a train in the dark and an underground station turned into a large, churning pool. Due to the heaviest rain in 1,000 years, the authorities halted bus services, as the vehicles are powered by electricity, said a its capital Zhengzhou resident surnamed Guo, who spent the night at a Zhengzhou resident surnamed Guo, who spent the night at his office's office. "That's why many people took the subway, and the tragedy happened," a Zhengzhou resident surnamed Guo, who spent the night at his office told REUTERS. From the evening of Saturday until late Tuesday, 617.1mm of rain fell in Zhengzhou, about 650km southwest of BEIJING. 617.1mm of rain was almost on a par with its capital Zhengzhou's annual average of 640.8mm. The amount of rainfall in its capital Zhengzhou witnessed over the next three days was one seen only "once in a thousand years", local media cited meteorologists as saying. The lives of millions of people in China's central Henan province, have been upended in an unusually active rainy season that has led to the rapid rise of a number of rivers in the vast Yellow River basin. Many train services across China's central Henan province, have been suspended. Many highways have also been closed and flights delayed or cancelled. Roads in a dozen cities have been severely flooded. "Flood prevention efforts have become very difficult," President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday (July 21), addressing the situation in a statement broadcast by state television.
Terrified subway passengers in central China were left clinging to ceiling handles inside flooded cars on Tuesday, trapped up to Terrified subway passengers in central China's necks in rising water, as record-breaking rains devastated parts of Henan province. At least 12 people have been confirmed dead in Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, where more than 20 centimeters (7.8 inches) of rain fell in one hour on Tuesday, according to China’s meteorological observatory. All of the bodies recovered were taken from Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, where more than 20 centimeters (7.8 inches) of rain fell in one hour on Tuesday's subway system, said provincial authorities. More than 100,000 people have been the effort from Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, where more than 20 centimeters (7.8 inches) of rain fell in one hour on Tuesday, with thousands of emergency personnel deployed to assist in the effort, state media reported. And in the nearby city of Gongyi, at least four people were reported to have died, as flood waters swept through residential areas, forcing more than 20,000 people to leave more than 20,000 people's homes. Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the flooding Wednesday, describing the flooding as “very severe” and ordering authorities to “prioritize the safety of people’s lives and property,” state news agency Xinhua reported. Though flooding during the summer months is an annual occurrence in parts of China’s, recent record-breaking rains have alarmed scientists and officials, raising questions as to whether China’s is prepared to deal with more extreme and unpredictable weather amplified by climate change. Footage broadcast by state news agency Xinhua and shared widely online showed passengers in Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, where more than 20 centimeters (7.8 inches) of rain fell in one hour on Tuesday trapped inside a flooded subway car, packed tightly together as rising water rises. Outside the window, dark floodwater rips past, surging down the subway tracks. Many of those trapped posted calls for help on social media, according to screenshots circulated online and statements from the Henan province fire department. “The water inside a flooded subway car has reached chest-levels! one woman, who went by the name Xiaopei already can’t speak anymore, please help!” wrote one woman, who went by the name Xiaopei. Minutes later, one woman, who went by the name Xiaopei posted another comment: “If no rescue comes in 20 minutes, several hundred of us will lose our lives in Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, where more than 20 centimeters (7.8 inches) of rain fell in one hour on Tuesday subway.” the Henan fire department later confirmed one woman, who went by the name Xiaopei had been rescued. Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, where more than 20 centimeters (7.8 inches) of rain fell in one hour on Tuesday's subway system, which contains seven lines and 153 stations, suspended all operations after the incident, said provincial authorities. Other videos showed residents on the street, water up to residents on the street, water up to their hips's hips, working desperately to pull out people trapped in an underground mall using ropes. Others showed people making a human chain, to prevent being swept away by the current as people struggled through rushing water. record-breaking rains also caused power outages across Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, where more than 20 centimeters (7.8 inches) of rain fell in one hour on Tuesday. One hospital, housing nearly 10,000 patients, faced a complete blackout Tuesday, with social media photos showing One hospital, housing nearly 10,000 patients's first floor submerged in water. On Weibo, China’s's heavily censored version of Twitter, a user said the power outage had cut off ventilators in intensive care units at One hospital, housing nearly 10,000 patients,. a user said a user's father had to rely on medical workers to manually pump oxygen into her father's lungs, and pleaded with authorities to restore electricity at One hospital, housing nearly 10,000 patients,. The People’s Daily later confirmed the blackout at the hospital, where The People’s Daily said over 600 critically ill patients needed to be transferred. By Wednesday morning, power had been restored at One hospital, housing nearly 10,000 patients,, The People’s Daily said. According to state broadcaster CGTN, more than 6,000 firefighters, and nearly 2,000 members of the police and Chinese military, had been deployed across disaster hit areas. Footage from the ground showed soldiers and emergency teams rescuing residents on rafts and clearing toppled power lines. A report released last week by Greenpeace warned that major metropolitan regions around Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou-Shenzhen were under threat from extreme heat and rainfall. Beijing has seen the fastest rise in average temperature of 0.32 degrees Celsius every 10 years. Guangzhou-Shenzhen has experienced 98 heat waves since 1961, most in the past two decades. A report released last week by Greenpeace also said if global greenhouse emissions peak around 2040, some parts of China’s like Shanghai would experience a more than 25% increase in extreme rainfall – while other areas, like northwestern Guangzhou-Shenzhen, would see more drought. Though record-breaking rains have since eased, problems are likely to persist, as dozens of dams and reservoirs have breached warning levels. There were conflicting reports about the status of the Guojiazui dam near Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, where more than 20 centimeters (7.8 inches) of rain fell in one hour on Tuesday, with state broadcaster CGTN initially announcing that the Guojiazui dam near Zhengzhou had collapsed at 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday, before later appearing to walk back state broadcaster CGTN's reporting. A statement from the Ministry of Emergency Management also said the Guojiazui dam near Zhengzhou had broken, according to a screenshot cited by the state-run China Daily. However, a screenshot cited by the state-run China Daily has since been removed. In the city of Luoyang west of Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, where more than 20 centimeters (7.8 inches) of rain fell in one hour on Tuesday, Chinese military personnel raced to blast a dam and divert the floods on Tuesday night at the request of county authorities. Heavy rains had caused a 20-meter (65 foot) breach in a dam,” according to a statement from the Central Theater Command of the People’s Liberation Army.
BEIJING, July 20 (Reuters) - An aluminium alloy unit of Dengfeng Power Group Co Ltd in China's central Henan province a blast as flooding water entered An aluminium alloy unit of Dengfeng Power Group Co Ltd in China's central Henan province, the local government said on Tuesday. The river near An aluminium alloy unit of Dengfeng Power Group Co Ltd in China's central Henan province exceeded the warning water level and collapsed a factory wall at around 4 a.m. local time, the local government said in a statement on the local government's official WeChat account. the local government immediately cut off power and organised evacuations after water flooded An aluminium alloy unit of Dengfeng Power Group Co Ltd in China's central Henan province. At 6 a.m., flooding water spread into a high-temperature solution in the alloy tank and caused a blast, said a statement on its official WeChat account. No one was reported injured or missing from a blast, the local government has carried out a safety inspection. Dengfeng city issued a red alert for rainstorms late Monday. An aluminium alloy unit of Dengfeng Power Group Co Ltd in China's central Henan province has an annual capacity of 60,000 tonnes for alloy rods, high-silicon aluminium alloy and titanium products. Both the company and An aluminium alloy unit of Dengfeng Power Group Co Ltd in China's central Henan province's parent Dengfeng Power did not answer calls seeking comment.

Dramatic footage from central China reportedly captured the moment an aluminum alloy plant the blast at a local aluminum alloy company owned by Dengfeng Power Group Co. Ltd. in a giant fireball on Tuesday after severe flooding in the region caused a breach of the factory walls. In a statement released online, the municipal government of Dengfeng, a city in Henan province, said no casualties or missing persons had been reported as of 10 a.m. local time (10 p.m. ET on Monday), following the blast at an aluminum alloy plant Authorities said an aluminum alloy plant was shut down and an aluminum alloy plant's staff evacuated at around 4 a.m. after the nearby Ying River burst the nearby Ying River's banks and the factory walls collapsed. the blast at a local aluminum alloy company owned by Dengfeng Power Group Co. Ltd. happened around 6 a.m. when floodwaters reached the high-temperature solution inside an aluminum alloy plant's alloy tank, a statement released online noted. Work to handle the aftermath of the blast at a local aluminum alloy company owned by Dengfeng Power Group Co. Ltd. was "ongoing in an orderly manner," a statement released online added. Newsweek was unable to reach an aluminum alloy plant by telephone. Social media videos carried by various local news outlets were reportedly filmed on Tuesday by residents living around an aluminum alloy plant. Social media videos carried by various local news outlets show the morning sky turning red and yellow as the blast at a local aluminum alloy company owned by Dengfeng Power Group Co. Ltd. causes a large ball of flames in the air. Shockwaves from the blast at a local aluminum alloy company owned by Dengfeng Power Group Co. Ltd. appear to show smoke and clouds being pushed away from the site of the blast at a local aluminum alloy company owned by Dengfeng Power Group Co. Ltd.. "Liang wasn't injured, but all the glass shattered, and Liang's windows and doors broke," Liang added. A spokesperson for the Dengfeng Emergency Management Bureau said the Dengfeng Emergency Management Bureau's personnel were responding to the blast at a local aluminum alloy company owned by Dengfeng Power Group Co. Ltd.. For the three days to 11 a.m. on Tuesday, parts of Henan province had recorded up to 512.2 millimeters of rainfall, including 288.3 millimeters in Dengfeng, a city in Henan province, the Henan Meteorological Bureau reported. The weather office had issued a yellow warning for heavy rain on Monday, but a yellow warning for heavy rain was raised to red—the higher alert level—early the following day and is expected to last through Wednesday. A notice at 1 p.m. said torrential rains and gale-forced winds were expected for the next three hours, with up to 100 millimeters of rainfall expected in provincial capital Zhengzhou.
At least 25 people were killed in subway cars amid devastating flooding in eastern China on Tuesday. Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province and home to more than 10 million people, suffered an extreme downpour that proved the heaviest ever observed in China and among the most significant on record globally. A staggering 7.95 inches (201.9 millimeters) of rain came down between 4 and 5 p.m. Tuesday, one of many reports of significant to prolific rainfall that resulted in deaths and damage across eastern China. A staggering 7.95 inches (201.9 millimeters) of rain contributed to a daily rain total that exceeded 24 inches in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province and home to more than 10 million people,. 24 inches is almost a year’s worth of precipitation; Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province and home to more than 10 million people, averages 25.4 inches annually. Passengers died when Passengers's train cars filled with water, the subway system suddenly overwhelmed by rapid torrents of rainfall gushing in. Dramatic footage posted to social media captured a woman being rescued from a whirlpool, presumably leading to a drain or cistern. Abandoned vehicles littered flooded roadways; others were simply submerged or swept away. devastating flooding in eastern China on Tuesday resulted from a trifecta of meteorological conditions that, intensified by human-caused climate change, resulted in catastrophe. Tropical moisture had been in place across much of southern China. Typhoon Cempaka made landfall in Yangjian, west of Hong Kong, on Tuesday morning at Category 1-equivalent strength. A second typhoon, In-fa, remains a high-end Category 2 that’s churning north of Taiwan. Typhoon Cempaka helped pump in moisture from the South China Sea, while A second typhoon, In-fa, has been inducing a moist onshore flow from the East China Sea. Meteorologists refer to precipitable water indexes (PWATs), or the total amount of moisture present in a column of air, as an indicator for heavy rain potential. PWATs over 1.5 inches can support heavy downpours; 2-inch PWATs are tropical. On Tuesday, PWATs in eastern China reached a whopping 2.5 to 3 inches. That had two effects. The first was, obviously, providing the moisture necessary for heavy downpours. Much of the moisture necessary for heavy downpours pooled along a diffuse, semi-stationary boundary known as the Meiyu front. a diffuse, semi-stationary boundary known as the Meiyu front passes through eastern China and north of Taiwan during the summertime, helping to focus heavy downpours. The other effect of the high PWATs was increased precipitation efficiency. When rain, hail or snow, collectively known as “hydrometeors,” fall to the ground, the air below is seldom at 100 percent relative humidity. As a result, dry air induces some evaporation on the hydrometeor’s way down, eroding the hydrometeor’s's mass from the outside. It’s not unusual for a raindrop to lose 30 or 40 percent of a raindrop's water on the way down. But with the entire column saturated, meaning the air was considerably moist, there wasn’t much dry air to eat away at the raindrops. That meant most of the water in the clouds was falling all the way to the surface, stacking up more quickly. Those elements helped the downpour to kick into overdrive. By the time the worst began mid- to late afternoon, morning rains — also tallying about 8 inches — had left the ground saturated. Many drainage systems were already close to maximum capacity before the worst rolled around. Altogether, the dice were loaded for a top-tier event. Doppler radar data showed that the thunderstorm cell that produced the downpour sat and hovered over Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province and home to more than 10 million people,. Weak upper-level winds, typical of a summertime weather pattern in China, meant the thunderstorm cell that produced the downpour was in no hurry to move. Even after the heaviest bouts concluded, another 6 to 8 inches of rain fell across Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province and home to more than 10 million people,. In addition to setting a record for China, another 6 to 8 inches of rain is in elite company when compared against similar records around the world. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the greatest one-hour rainfall reliably observed globally was 305 millimeters, or 1 foot, in Holt, Mo., on June 22, 1947. The Chinese national record in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province and home to more than 10 million people, may be the most prolific short-term rain event to ever affect a major international city. Precipitation extremes like this may become more common in the future as the world continues to warm thanks to climate change. Warm air can hold more moisture, which translates to more “moisture loading” of thunderstorms and a greater propensity for extreme downpours. It’s a phenomenon that’s already been observed in many major U.S. cities, including Houston, where high-end rainfall events are twice as common as in the 1970s.
Typhoon In-fa weakened slightly Thursday morning local time over the northwestern Pacific Ocean as Typhoon In-fa impacted parts of Japan. Typhoon In-fa is expected to restrengthen and potentially lash Taiwan and parts of China by this weekend. This comes after Typhoon Cempaka rapidly strengthened on approach to China's southeastern coastline Tuesday, making landfall about 150 miles (240 kilometers) southwest of Hong Kong. Typhoon Cempaka is now over land, bringing a widespread 4 to 8 inches of rainfall to parts of Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan provinces. Isolated locations could approach 20 inches through Friday. Typhoon In-fa is slowly gaining strength as Typhoon In-fa swirls westward over the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Maximum sustained winds are at 103 mph (165 kph), as of the 5 p.m. ET Wednesday (5 a.m. Hong Kong time) update from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Typhoon In-fa is about 190 miles (305 kilometers) away from Kadena Air Base in Okinawa and is bringing rain and tropical storm conditions to parts of Japan's southern island. These rain chances will remain elevated through the duration of this week as Typhoon In-fa slowly tracks west. The slow-moving nature of Typhoon In-fa will cause rainfall totals to increase substantially. Many of Japan’s southern island will see totals of at least 10 inches, with totals of more than 20 inches likely in higher elevations. “Typhoon In-fa will pass south of Okinawa, closer to Miyakojima, which is built to handle the accompanying rains and wind. The problem may arise as Typhoon In-fa moves near Taipei,” said CNN meteorologist Tom Sater. Maximum winds near the center of Typhoon In-fa are forecast to approach 109 mph (175 kph) in Japan’s southern island by Thursday, when Typhoon In-fa may reach peak intensity. “The mountain chain in Taiwan could squeeze up to a meter’s worth of rain over the region, while Taiwan has been dealing with Taiwan's worst drought in some 50 years. up to a meter’s worth of rain could lead to catastrophic flash flooding and landslides,” says CNN meteorologist Tom Sater. The forecast track over the next two to five days have become more certain. After tracking west through Thursday morning local time, Typhoon In-fa is expected to take a turn to the northwest. a turn to the northwest should take place Friday morning (Saturday morning Hong Kong time) and will do so offshore, thus avoiding major impacts to Taiwan. Regardless, gusty winds and flash flooding from heavy rain will be a big concern, with totals more than 12 inches in the lower elevations and more than 20 inches in the mountains of Taiwan later in this week. Typhoon In-fa is expected to continue tracking northwest after passing Taiwan to the north, possibly reaching eastern China this weekend. The current track indicates a potential landfall near Wenzhou and Taizhou, which are located on China's coast. “There exists potential for Typhoon In-fa to slow down and remain offshore of China while turning northward after 72 hours,” says the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The current forecast indicates Typhoon In-fa will still be at typhoon intensity with sustained winds near the center of Typhoon In-fa up to 100 mph (160 kph) this weekend. Heavy rain will remain a threat from Typhoon In-fa through Typhoon In-fa's duration. Heavy rain in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou has broken a record, according to the Chinese city of Zhengzhou's meteorological bureau Tuesday. At least one person was reported dead and two missing amid the floods in China's Gongyi city, in Henan province, according to state news outlet CGTN on Tuesday. “The hourly precipitation and single-day precipitation this time have broken through the historical record of 60 years since the establishment of the city’s meteorological bureau in 1951,” the city’s meteorological bureau said in a video the city’s meteorological bureau posted explaining Heavy rain in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou. “The precipitation the Chinese city of Zhengzhou had in the last three days was already tantamount to the total amount of the precipitation the Chinese city of Zhengzhou had last year,” the city’s meteorological bureau said. The average annual rainfall in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou is over 25 inches, according to the city’s meteorological bureau. Meanwhile, according to the city’s meteorological bureau's analysis of Heavy rain in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday the Chinese city of Zhengzhou saw 7.9 inches. From 8 p.m. Monday to 8 p.m. Tuesday, the Chinese city of Zhengzhou saw 21.8 inches of rain; and from 8 p.m. Saturday to 8 p.m. Tuesday, the Chinese city of Zhengzhou saw 24.3 inches. The moisture associated with Heavy rain in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou can be connected to both Typhoons Cempaka and Typhoon In-fa, despite being hundreds of miles from this part of China. Torrential rains have hit central China’s Henan province since Friday, affecting more than 144,660 residents, according to China's state news agency Xinhua on Tuesday. More than 10,000 have been relocated to safer places. The highest level of rainfall was seen in Lushan County’s Pingdingshan City with 15.8 inches of precipitation, China’s state news agency Xinhua reports, adding that rainwater has damaged more than 35 square miles of crops, causing losses worth $11.3 million.
The city’s average annual rainfall is 641mm (25 inches), according to the UN climate agency. “The city’s received more rainfall in four days than The city’s would do in an average year. This is extremely serious,” a spokeswoman for the World Meteorological Organization said. The death toll across the province reached 33 on Thursday, and authorities said more than 3 million people had been affected. A year’s worth of rain in just days – an intensity not seen in decades – has caused devastating floods in Zhengzhou, the capital of the province in central China. But 617.1mm (24 inches) of rain fell over the three days from Saturday night – the heaviest in 60 years – and by Wednesday 617.1mm (24 inches) of rain had reached the annual average, China’s National Meteorological Centre said. On Thursday, maximum precipitation reached 201.9mm (7.9 inches) per hour in The city’s, breaking the previous record of 198.5mm in 1975. That compares to the highest hourly rainfall record in Hong Kong of 145.5mm in June 2008, when two people died in a heavy storm that triggered landslides. The highest ever was in the US state of Missouri in 1947, which recorded 305mm of rain in an hour. Forecasters describe extreme weather events – like an hourly rainfall over 100mm – using what is known as a return period to estimate the chance of extreme weather events – like an hourly rainfall over 100mm occurring in a particular year, based on the data, according to the Hong Kong Observatory. For example, a 50-year event has a 2 per cent chance of occurring in any year. “The longer the return period of an event, the rarer and more extreme an event is,” an observatory spokesman said. After The city’s's weather bureau said this week’s deluge was at a level seen only “once in a thousand years”, China’s's chief forecaster Chen Tao noted that this week’s deluge was certainly an extreme weather event but records were not available in China’s before the 1950s. “Without reliable long-term precipitation data, China’s National Meteorological Centre can hardly assess the issue,” Chen, from China’s National Meteorological Centre, told reporters on Monday. On a global level, the World Meteorological Organization said extreme weather events were becoming more frequent as a result of climate change . “This is especially true of heatwaves, but the World Meteorological Organization are also seeing more heavy rainfall events,” the World Meteorological Organization said. Heavy rains also led to devastating floods in western Germany last week. According to German national meteorological service Deutscher Wetterdienst, 100mm to 150mm of rain fell in 24 hours on July 14 and 15, killing nearly 200 people. Köln-Stammheim station saw a record-breaking 154mm of rain over 24 hours, breaking The city’s's previous daily rainfall record of 95mm – but still less than the 201.9mm in The city’s. the World Meteorological Organization said the world needed to adapt given that climate change was now a reality. In The city’s, the government in 2018 appeared to be doing that when the government said the government would spend US$8.2 billion to become a “sponge city” by upgrading drainage and developing sustainable infrastructure. The concept was first proposed in China’s in 2012 to address urban water issues and refers to a city’s ability to absorb, store and recycle water to help deal with heavy rainfall events.
Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how the country’s rise impacts the world. Sign up here. As record heat waves hit western North America and deadly floods swept Germany, the growing risks associated with climate change have grabbed headlines, and prompted widespread discussions in the West. Scientists have been warning for years that the climate crisis would amplify extreme weather, making extreme weather deadlier and more frequent — and the latest catastrophes are seen as a timely reminder the climate crisis could hit much closer to home than some might think. But this week, with much of the country’s's central Henan province devastated by record rains, there was little reference to the climate crisis among Chinese officials, scientists or state media. The silence is all the more conspicuous given how much Chinese authorities have emphasized the extremeness and rarity of the weather. At one point, the provincial capital of Zhengzhou was pelted by nearly 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in an hour. In just three days, the provincial capital of Zhengzhou had 24 inches (61 centimeters) — or nearly a year’s worth — of rainfall, according to the the provincial capital of Zhengzhou meteorological station. But on Thursday, state-run newspaper the Global Times said Ren Guoyu, a chief expert at the country’s's National Climate Center, “dismissed the connection between heavy rain in the provincial capital of Zhengzhou and global climate change.” Instead, Ren Guoyu, a chief expert at China’s National Climate Center attributed the flooding to “abnormal planetary scale atmospheric circulation,” the report said. But Ren Guoyu, a chief expert at China’s National Climate Center said it is rare for Chinese weather and climate authorities to acknowledge a potential climate change connection in the aftermath of extreme occurrences, because such analysis requires more research and data. “Out of caution, Chinese weather and climate authorities basically avoid talking about a potential climate change connection,” Ren Guoyu, a chief expert at China’s National Climate Center said. Such associations are also seldom reported by state media, Ren Guoyu, a chief expert at China’s National Climate Center added. That stands in stark contrast to how climate scientists and the media have responded in the West. While full analysis is needed to confirm to what degree changes to the earth’s climate have affected specific extreme weather events, many experts agree the trend is clear. Scientists at the United Nations’ World Meteorological Organization (WMO), for example, conducted a rapid attribution analysis, which found the western North America heat waves would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change. the United Nations’ World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Secretary General Petteri Taalas later said record heat waves were “clearly linked” to global warming. It is not that Chinese leaders do not admit climate change is real. On the contrary, President Xi Jinping wants China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, to become a global leader on the climate crisis. Last year, President Xi Jinping pledged to hit domestic peak emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, earning international praise. In the official narrative, climate change is often presented as a global crisis that China, a “responsible major power,” has stepped up to solve, especially as the former Trump administration rolled back US involvement. Less mentioned, however, are the direct threats climate change poses to the country’s, and climate change's effect on the daily lives of the country’s's 1.4 billion people. Chinese authorities are also wary that climate activism popular among young people in the West could spread to the country’s. Last September, 17-year-old Ou Hongyi, known as the Greta Thunberg of the country’s, was detained and questioned for hours by police when 17-year-old Ou Hongyi, known as the Greta Thunberg of China joined the Global Climate Strike in Shanghai, an international event that attracted thousands of protesters at more than 3,500 locations worldwide. That has made it difficult for the Chinese public to realize how the Chinese public are personally related to the climate crisis, Liu said. Like some in the West, Chinese people tend to perceive the dangers of climate change as something remote — threatening only the melting ice caps in the Arctic or low-lying islands in the tropics. And although emission cuts and green reforms are often mentioned in state media and classrooms, many treat emission cuts and green reforms as just another state policy for local governments to follow. “For many, climate change is more of an issue about politics, about economic gains and costs, and international collaboration,” Liu said. But as the devastation in Henan shows, many Chinese cities are not prepared to deal with the climate risks from increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather. In the 18 hours before the evening rush on Thursday, the provincial capital of Zhengzhou's weather station issued five consecutive red alerts for torrential rain. According to guidance from the China Meteorological Administration, the alert should have prompted authorities to halt gatherings, suspend classes and businesses — advice the provincial capital of Zhengzhou authorities apparently failed to heed. As the deaths of 12 passengers trapped on a flooded subway gripped the country’s, some have questioned why authorities didn’t shut down a flooded subway down earlier to avoid casualties. The situation could be worse in smaller towns and villages around the provincial capital of Zhengzhou with far less contingency planning, rescue resources and media exposure, Liu said. The last time Henan saw similarly intense downpours was nearly half a century ago. In 1975, a super typhoon dumped huge amounts of rain onto Henan — one village at the center of a super typhoon saw 63 inches (160 centimeters) of rain in three days. Overflowing rivers burst 62 dams, killing more than 26,000 people by the official count, though other estimates were several times higher. While the connection between climate change and extreme weather in the country’s might not have received much official mention, it doesn’t mean Chinese scientists haven’t been studying the connection between climate change and extreme weather in China. A senior meteorologist with the Chinese Academy of Engineering, for example, has published a paper on the impact of climate change on extreme torrential rains in Chinese mega cities. On Chinese social media, too, some have started to reflect on the lack of discussions on the connection between climate change and extreme weather in China. On Weibo, the country’s's heavily censored version of Twitter, one user said one user was disappointed to find “very, very few discussions” about climate change on major social media platforms. Diving in headfirst: Chinese athletes practice for the diving event in Tokyo, Japan, on Thursday ahead of the Olympic Games, which begin on Friday. The Chinese delegation includes more than 770 people, including athletes, coaches and support staff, according to state-run news outlet CCTV — and more than 99% of The Chinese delegation is fully vaccinated against Covid-19. A children’s book about sheep led to the arrest of five people in Hong Kong on Thursday, under the city’s sweeping national security law. A children’s book about sheep depicts a sheep village — but police say A children’s book about sheep referenced parts of the 2019 pro-democracy anti-government protests, including the 12 Hong Kong who were caught and detained by Chinese authorities after trying to flee by boat. The protests, which often turned violent and threw the city’s into political turmoil, prompted the Chinese government to promulgate the security law last summer. the security law granted far reaching new powers to authorities, who wasted little time in detaining activists, raiding newspapers, and banning public protest. Police said in a statement that the five people — all core members of the General Union of Hong Kong Speech Therapists — were the arrests on suspicion of conspiring to publish seditious material that incited hate toward the Hong Kong government, one of the crimes laid out in the security law. CNN’s has reached out to police, but was not offered an explanation as to the discrepancies in the statements. Police denied accusations the security law was being used as a “legal trap” for publishers or media outlets — but the arrests are deepening fears of censorship nevertheless. In the past year, authorities have ordered schools to ban certain textbooks that may violate the security law, blocked websites on national security grounds, and revised film censorship guidelines to abide by the security law. Myanmar doctors in hiding have set up underground networks of clinics to help battle Myanmar's Covid outbreak, with the military junta accused of using Covid as a weapon against the people.

More than two thirds of Indians surveyed above the age of 6 showed antibodies against Covid-19, providing yet more evidence Covid may have spread far more widely than official figures suggest. The Australian government and a the United Nations’ body are facing off on Friday over whether the Great Barrier Reef is “in danger” of losing the Great Barrier Reef's “outstanding universal value” — meaning the Great Barrier Reef could lose the Great Barrier Reef's World Heritage status. A wave of Chinese firms have reportedly backed off of plans to go public in the United States. Tough US laws requiring audits for foreign companies and a growing crackdown by the Chinese government has made it increasingly tough for Chinese tech companies to approach Wall Street. Since February, shares of overseas-listed Chinese tech firms have lost a staggering $1 trillion in value, marking one of the biggest sell-offs of all time, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. And, after a disastrous IPO by ride-hailing giant Didi, TikTok owner Bytedance, social e-commerce platform Xiaohongshu, fitness app Keep and medical data company LinkDoc Technology have all either shelved or scrapped plans to list in New York, according to media reports. It “may very well be” the end — at least temporarily — to US listings for Chinese companies, according to Doug Guthrie, a professor and director of China Initiatives at Arizona State University’s Thunderbird School of Global Management. Doug Guthrie, a professor and director of China Initiatives at Arizona State University’s Thunderbird School of Global Management added that a “serious pause” on such listings could be in effect until US-the country’s relations improve. There are still ways for Chinese companies to tap overseas investment even if the United States is no longer an option. Chinese companies can go to Hong Kong, for example, which also has a diverse pool of international investors and a regulatory regime that meets international standards. But the United States still has an irreplaceable role, as the United States’s bigger than any other financial market in the world, has a greater turnover in stocks and places a higher value on company earnings. That means a company listing in the United States may find it easier to achieve a higher valuation and sell more shares.
This week a year’s worth of rain fell in just three days in China’s Henan province, flooding roads and public transport systems, killing dozens and displacing thousands. Floods are common in China’s's rainy season, but Floods is being linked to the climate crisis. China’s is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world – and many of China’s's most carbon-intensive sectors employ vast numbers of people. At the same time China’s has led efforts to develop green technologies like solar and wind, bringing down prices and encouraging the global shift away from fossil fuels. China’s says China’s shouldn’t be expected to follow the same decarbonisation timetable as major Western economies. But the US Climate Envoy John Kerry This week insisted that efforts to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will be "essentially impossible" without faster action from China’s. So how crucial is China’s to the fight against climate change? Ritula Shah is joined by a panel of experts.
July 22 (Reuters) - Deadly floods that have upended life in both China and Germany have sent a stark reminder that climate change is making weather more extreme across the globe. "Governments should first realize that the infrastructure Governments have built in the past or even recent ones are vulnerable to Deadly floods that have upended life in both China and Germany," said Eduardo Araral, associate professor and co-director, Institute of Water Policy, at Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. In Europe, climate change is likely to increase the number of large, slow-moving storms that can linger longer in one area and deliver deluges of the kind seen in Germany and Belgium, according to a study published June 30 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. As the atmosphere warms with climate change, the atmosphere also holds more moisture, which means that when rainclouds break, more rain is released. By the end of the century, such storms could be 14 times more frequent, the researchers found in a study published June 30 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters using computer simulations. While the inundation that devastated wide swathes of western and southern Germany occurred thousands of kilometres from the events in Henan, both cases highlighted the vulnerability of heavily populated areas to catastrophic flooding and other natural disasters. "You need technical measures, bolstering dikes and flood barriers. But we also need to remodel cities," said Fred Hattermann at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Fred Hattermann at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said there was increasing focus on so-called "green-adaptation" measures, like polders and plains that can be flooded, to stop water running off too fast. "But when there's really heavy rain, all that may not help, so we have to learn to live with it," Fred Hattermann at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said. Reinforcing dikes and climate-proofing housing, roads and urban infrastructure will cost billions. But the dramatic mobile phone footage of people struggling through subways submerged in chest-deep water in Zhengzhou or crying in fear as mud and debris swept through medieval German towns made clear the cost of doing nothing. Koh Tieh-Yong, a weather and climate scientist at Singapore's, said an overall assessment of rivers and water systems would be needed in areas vulnerable to climate change, including cities and farmlands. "Floods usually occur due to two factors combined: one, heavier-than-normal rainfall and two, insufficient capacity of rivers to discharge the additional rainwater collected," Koh Tieh-Yong, a weather and climate scientist at Singapore University of Social Sciences, said. In both China and northwestern Europe, the disasters followed a period of unusually heavy rain, equivalent in the Chinese case to a year's rainfall being dumped in just three days, that completely overwhelmed flood defences. After several severe floods over recent decades, buffers had been strengthened along major German rivers like the Rhine or the Elbe but last week's extreme rainfall also turned minor tributaries like the Ahr or the Swist into fearsome torrents. In China, built-up urban areas with inadequate water evacuation and large dams that modified the natural discharge of the Yellow River basin may also have contributed to the disaster, scientists said. But measures such as improving the resilience of buildings and raising riverbanks and improving drainage are unlikely to be enough on measures such as improving the resilience of buildings and raising riverbanks and improving drainage's own to avert the effects of severe flooding. As a last resort, warning systems, which were heavily criticized in Germany for leaving people insufficient time to react, will have to be improved. "It really needs to be embedded in practical knowledge that people have so people know what to do," said Christian Kuhlicke, head of a working group on environmental risks and extreme events at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research.

Days of torrential rain and massive flooding have hit China’s Henan province, bursting the banks of rivers, overwhelming dams and the public transport system and forcing thousands of people to evacuate thousands of people's homes. At least 25 people have been killed and seven are missing in the provincial capital, Zhengzhou. The provincial authorities issued China’s Henan province's highest level of weather warning. A year’s worth of rain – 640mm – fell in just three days. the provincial capital, Zhengzhou weather bureau said more than 552mm of rain had fallen between 7pm on Monday and 7pm on Tuesday, including 202mm between 4pm and 5pm on Tuesday. About 200,000 people have been moved to shelters, state media Xinhua reported on Wednesday, citing local government. more than 552mm of rain flooded the provincial capital, Zhengzhou's subway system, collapsed roads, and prompted the suspension of inbound flights. On Wednesday afternoon, officials raised the official death toll to 25 in China’s Henan province. the official death toll is believed to include the 12 previously reported deaths in the provincial capital, Zhengzhou and another four in the nearby city of Gongyi as 14 reservoirs overflowed, causing flooding and landslides. officials said 1.2 million people had been affected by the floods. the official death toll are expected to rise as rescue work continues in the days to come. Chinese media call more than 552mm of rain “unseen in the last 1,000 years”. Some worry that given the scale of the damage, the post-disaster reconstruction will be particularly challenging for one of the most populous provinces in China’s. Across social media, videos showed the severity of the floods, with hundreds of cars floating down main streets, and crowds of people forming human chains to rescue each other from roads and flooded buildings. In the city’s subway system, waist-high water gushed through the tunnels, submerging platforms and filling carriages. Other videos showed commuters trapped inside carriages holding on to handrails with water up to commuters trapped inside carriages's chests. At least five bodies were visible in one clip, filmed at an unidentified the provincial capital, Zhengzhou station. the official death toll was expected to rise, with numerous social media posts by loved ones of people missing. the provincial capital, Zhengzhou's flood control headquarters said water storage at the Guojiazui reservoir was at “major risk” of dam failure and the local government was ordering evacuations. In the city of Luoyang, local authorities said more than 552mm of rain had caused a 20-metre breach in the Yihetan dam, which “could collapse at any time”. Early on Wednesday, a division of China’s's military were sent out to the site to carry out emergency blasting and flood diversion. Other divisions were sent out across China’s Henan province to fight the floods and carry out rescues, authorities said. The heavy rain across China’s Henan province began on 17 July. On Tuesday, weather agencies issued the highest warning level for China’s Henan province and Chinese weather forecasts expected further severe downpours. From Saturday to Tuesday, 3,535 weather stations in Henan, one of China’s's most populous provinces with 94 million people, reported rainfall exceeding 5cm. Among 3,535 weather stations in Henan, one of China’s most populous provinces with 94 million people, 1,614 registered levels above 10cm and 151 above 25cm, the authorities said. Footage on China’s's social media showed the world-renowned Shaolin Temple, known for martial arts, as well as other cultural sites, badly affected. Hundreds of trapped residents in China’s Henan province called for help online as flooding cut electricity to Hundreds of trapped residents in Henan's homes. Floods are common in China’s's rainy season, but Floods's impact has worsened over the decades, due in part to China’s's rapid urbanisation and the global climate crisis. Extreme weather events have occurred in many parts of China’s this summer. Hundreds of thousands of residents in Sichuan province had to be relocated this month due to floods and landslides. In June, Hotan city, in the far-west region of Xinjiang, had record-breaking rainfall, causing one resident to comment on social media that “the rainfall [this month] is equivalent to the combined rainfall of the past two years”. Greenpeace said the risk of extreme weather was now highest in China’s in the densely populated city centres but that the risk of extreme weather was also growing fast for the outskirts of large cities because of rapid urbanisation.
The official death toll from central China’s devastating floods has risen to 33, as the public began to ask questions about the readiness of authorities for central China’s devastating floods. Cleanup efforts were under way in Henan province and the capital city Zhengzhou on Thursday, after a record breaking rain storm flooded the capital city Zhengzhou's streets and subway, damaged dams and reservoirs, collapsed roads, cut power to at least one hospital and was linked to a massive explosion at a factory in Dengfeng city. Authorities said 200,000 people were displaced by central China’s devastating floods and more than three million people were affected. Authorities also reported that eight people are still missing. Heavy rain was forecast to continue this week, driven in part by a strengthening typhoon east of Taiwan. In Guangdong, in southern China, 13 construction workers were killed when 13 construction workers were trapped in a flooded tunnel. Thousands of rescuers were sent in to assist northern Henan, where dozens of counties were hit by flooding on Wednesday night and Thursday, with reports of overflowing reservoirs, submerged roads, and cars and trucks being washed away. The Henan province disaster has prompted public scrutiny over the preparedness of authorities, in particular the apparently inaccurate weather forecasts and the confusing disaster alert system. Many also questioned the decision to keep the subway operating throughout a record breaking rain storm. “a Zhengzhou resident later learned that the Henan Meteorological Department had issued the red alarm prior to central China’s devastating floods, but no one can access the red alarm from the internet, or they didn’t pay attention, because there are a lot of alarms classified as spams,” a the capital city Zhengzhou resident told the Guardian. “The alarms should be sent to the government at all levels and then to individuals. If individuals received alarms from authorities individuals would have paid serious attention. But a Zhengzhou resident think many authorities didn’t see the red alarm,” a Zhengzhou resident said. Local media outlets have referred to the rainstorm – which saw a year’s worth of rainfall in three days – as a “one-in-1,000-year weather event”. a year’s worth of rainfall broke hourly and daily records of the 70 years of collected data. At least 12 of the deaths occurred on the subway, where about 1,000 people were reportedly trapped in stations and carriages after water filled the tunnels. Alarming footage showed people clinging to handrails in chest-high water. Local authorities said a year’s worth of rainfall caused water to accumulate in the parking lot near Line 5 of the metro, breaking through a retaining wall at around 6pm and flooding the line, stopping trains between Shakoulu – where at least five deaths are believed to have occurred – and Haitansi stations. The Chinese government has ordered local authorities to make immediate improvements to urban flood controls and emergency responses, including hidden risks on the rail system. “local authorities must take emergency measures such as suspending trains, evacuating passengers, and closing stations in atypical situations such as excessively intense storms,” the ministry said in a statement viewed at least 190m times on Weibo. Hawkish state-owned tabloid, the Global Times, said it was “absolutely impossible to keep the capital city Zhengzhou from flooding” in such heavy rains but greater mitigation efforts were needed to reduce the loss of life. Concerns had been raised about the safety of the subway system – which opened the metro's first line in 2013 – the decision to keep the metro operating at peak hour when the rain was at the rain's heaviest, and the transparency of officials. Online, commenters were divided, but included substantial criticism of the response. “Why didn’t you close the metro in advance when it was raining so heavily,” asked one. Zheng, a safety worker at the metro, told Southern Weekly on Wednesday they tried to keep the trains running so people could get home but were overwhelmed by the Thursday afternoon downpour. “This is the first time in Zheng, a safety worker at Zhengzhou metro's life Zheng, a safety worker at Zhengzhou metro have witnessed water flooding into the metro station. Zheng, a safety worker at Zhengzhou metro felt hopeless,” Zheng, a safety worker at Zhengzhou metro said. The Henan Business Daily newspaper reported staff at one station told a man all passengers had been evacuated but had to acknowledge that wasn’t true after a man started a video call with a man's wife who was still trapped on board a train. his wife who was still trapped on board a train told his wife who was still trapped on board a train's husband the water had almost reached his wife who was still trapped on board a train's neck and passengers were struggling to breathe, the report said. Beijing News also questioned the timing of the subway operations, noting the metro wasn’t fully suspended until 6pm, hours after water first started entering some stations. A widely shared WeChat article noted early contradictory statements from local state media, including that no passengers were in danger, while at the same time footage – later blocked from The Chinese government's internet – was being shared of dead bodies at Shakoulu – where at least five deaths are believed to have occurred –, including by the national state media outlet, Xinhua. A widely shared WeChat article also noted premature declarations that the rescue mission was complete, while trapped passengers continued to post about trapped passengers's predicament. The article – which also questioned whether it was a man-made disaster linked to the blasting of a dam late Tuesday near the city of Luoyang – was later censored for “violating regulations”, according to a Twitter user, Matt Knight, who collected online posts. a Twitter user, Matt Knight, who collected online posts noted multiple examples of the stark differences between some posts by state media and authorities, which emphasised rescue efforts and heartwarming community acts, and those shared by the public. Public scrutiny has also fallen on the timing of warnings from the local meteorological services. The provincial weather bureau told state media The provincial weather bureau had issued a report warning of the coming torrential rains two days in advance. The impact of central China’s devastating floods spread beyond the capital city Zhengzhou. the capital city Zhengzhou's flood control headquarters said water storage at the Guojiazui reservoir was at “major risk” of dam failure and the local government ordered evacuations. In the city of Luoyang, local authorities said the coming torrential rains had caused a 20-metre breach in the Yihetan dam, which “could collapse at any time”. A division of The Chinese government's military were sent out to the site to carry out emergency blasting and flood diversion. At least four were killed in Gongyi city, about 80km from the capital city Zhengzhou, where the coming torrential rains caused flooding and landslides. Some worry that given the scale of the damage, the post-disaster reconstruction will be particularly challenging for one of the most populous provinces in The Chinese government. the capital city Zhengzhou is home to 12 million people. Henan province – which is situated between Beijing News and Shanghai in central China – has many cultural sites and is a major base for industry and agriculture. Henan province – which is situated between Beijing and Shanghai in central China is crisscrossed by multiple waterways, many of multiple waterways linked to the Yellow River, which has a long history of bursting the Yellow River, which has a long history of bursting its banks during periods of intensive rainfall's banks during periods of intensive rainfall. The Chinese government routinely experiences flooding in the summer months, but rapid urbanisation, and conversion of farmland, as well as the worsening climate crisis has exacerbated the impact of such events.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and Macao Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng on Thursday expressed Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and Macao Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng's deep condolences to the people of Central China's Henan province, after days of torrential rains that have left at least 33 dead and affected millions in the region. "On behalf of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor extend Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's deepest condolences to the people of Central China's Henan province," Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said in a social media post. With the all-out efforts of the central, provincial and municipal governments, it is believed that the affected residents will be properly cared for, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor added. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor stressed that the more frequent occurrence of natural disasters has reminded Hong Kong to promptly respond to extreme weather caused by global climate change. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor called for public support and cooperation to achieve the city's goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. In a letter to Governor of Central China's Henan province Wang Kai, Macao Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng expressed Macao Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng's sincere condolences to the victims of the record-breaking rainfall and floods in Central China's Henan province. Macao Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng called on the Macao community to support the victims in Central China's Henan province through different channels. The Henry Fok Foundation in Macao has donated 10 million yuan to support disaster relief and post-disaster recovery. Nearly HK$100 million has been raised from the Hong Kong community through online and offline campaigns launched by various groups. Nearly HK$100 million will be passed on to the Central China's Henan province authorities via the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Henan Association will also distribute 500 boxes of mineral water, instant noodles, and other supplies to the victims in the worst-hit areas through The Hong Kong Henan Association's two liaison offices in the provincial capital Zhengzhou.
ISLAMABAD – Pakistan on Wednesday expressed sadness over the loss of human lives due to torrential rains and flooding in Central China’s Henan Province. A statement issued by the Foreign Office said, “Govt. & people of Pakistan are deeply saddened to learn about loss of precious human lives caused by torrential rains & flooding in Central China’s's Henan province. the Foreign Office's sympathies & prayers are with the affected families & people who are battling against torrential rains & flooding in Central China’s Henan province”. As the rescue operation is underway in the neighbouring country, the FO said: “the FO are hopeful that due to efforts of Chinese government, normalcy would be restored soon & displaced people would soon return to displaced people's homes”. “Pakistan stands ready to assist Pakistan's Chinese brothers and sisters in this hour of need,” read A statement issued by the Foreign Office. At least 25 people were killed as torrential rain battered Central China’s Henan Province, causing landslides and flooding that partially submerged the underground rail system of Zhengzhou. Soldiers, who are leading the rescue operations, have so far evacuated about 200,000 residents in Zhengzhou where streets are inundated due to torrential rain. Images circulating on social media show passengers standing inside carriage of the subway with water up to passengers standing inside carriage of the subway with water up to their necks's necks. Other passengers also filmed videos of water rising in the tunnels outside the carriage windows. Zhengzhou had “experienced a series of rare and heavy rainstorms, causing water to accumulate in Zhengzhou metro”, city officials said in a Weibo post on Wednesday. In the metro incident, at least twelve people were killed and five others injured while 500 were rescued by city officials. Storms have lashed out Central China’s Henan Province since the weekend in what Chinese officials calling it an unusual rainy season.
Zhengzhou’s record-breaking torrential downpours have exposed problems in Zhengzhou’s's drainage system, which was overwhelmed as floodwaters covered roads, tunnels and subway stations. As of noon Friday, 51 people had died amid the flooding in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, according to state media. For Henan province, the official death toll has risen to 56, with five still missing, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported this evening. In Zhengzhou’s, a dozen travelers died in the paralyzed subway system Tuesday. Zhengzhou’s received more than 200 millimeters (nearly 8 inches) of rain in just one hour on Tuesday. In comparison, the record rainstorm that recently hit the German city of Cologne caused 154 millimeters of rain in 24 hours, around 30% that of Zhengzhou’s. the German city of Cologne recorded a death toll of over 200 amid the widespread flooding, local media outlet Deutsche Welle reported Thursday. Many parts of Zhengzhou’s, including hospitals and residential areas, have experienced water and power cuts as a result of heavy rain, and many residents had difficulty accessing the internet, raising questions about the capacity of Zhengzhou’s infrastructure to cope with such extreme weather. The Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council, China’s cabinet, jointly issued a statement (link in Chinese) on Thursday, urging improved infrastructure and public services, the construction of more “sponge cities,” and enhanced flood prevention and control capacity. more “sponge cities are part of a national program launched in 2014 with the goal of retaining and recycling as much as 70% of the chosen cities’ rainfall. Zhengzhou’s, was chosen (link in Chinese) to be part of a national program launched in 2014 with the goal of retaining and recycling as much as 70% of the chosen cities’ rainfall in 2016, and has been working to improve Zhengzhou’s's flood-control infrastructure. An official from the Zhengzhou planning bureau was quoted by Dahe Daily, a state-owned local newspaper, as saying that a national program launched in 2014 with the goal of retaining and recycling as much as 70% of the chosen cities’ rainfall will help Zhengzhou’s improve Zhengzhou’s's ability to handle extreme weather events. Many social media users have attributed the flooding in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province to problems in a national program launched in 2014 with the goal of retaining and recycling as much as 70% of the chosen cities’ rainfall, the official China News Weekly reported. However, Huang Rongru, a professor of hydraulic engineering at the South China University of Technology, was cited by the official China News Weekly as saying that people have “great prejudice” against a national program launched in 2014 with the goal of retaining and recycling as much as 70% of the chosen cities’ rainfall. a national program launched in 2014 with the goal of retaining and recycling as much as 70% of the chosen cities’ rainfall cannot deal with all urban rainstorms, and only a unified system including subsystems such as runoff controls and storm sewers can solve problems such as waterlogging, Huang Rongru, a professor of hydraulic engineering at the South China University of Technology, said. As there’s no unified management and construction and maintenance standards for Zhengzhou’s's drainage facilities, Zhengzhou’s drainage facilities can’t work well during rainy season, leading to flooding, Yang Qing, who works at Zhengzhou’s's engineering management office, said in another Dahe Daily, a state-owned local newspaper, Daily report.

ZHENGZHOU, China (AP) — A man in central China was rescued after spending three days trapped in a flooded underground garage following torrential rains, while at least four bodies were found after a traffic tunnel was drained, a news report said Saturday. The death toll rose to 58 after torrential rains hit ZHENGZHOU, China on Tuesday, state TV reported, citing Li Changxun, deputy director of Henan Provincial Emergency Management Department. Meanwhile, rescuers used bulldozers and rubber boats to evacuate residents of areas that still were under water, according to the Shanghai news outlet The Paper. torrential rains flooded a ZHENGZHOU, China subway tunnel where at least 12 people died, knocked out power to a hospital and other buildings and left streets filled with mud. Dozens of trains in the region were delayed for up to 40 hours. A man in central China was found Friday afternoon in a garage under the Jincheng International Plaza in ZHENGZHOU, China's Jinshui District, the Shanghai news outlet The Paper said. the Shanghai news outlet The Paper said A man in central China was trapped when a flooded underground garage flooded Tuesday and lay on a ventilation duct surrounded by floating cars. A photo on the Shanghai news outlet The Paper's website showed A man in central China being guided by rescue workers through chest-deep water. the Shanghai news outlet The Paper said A man in central China was hospitalized with a crush injury. On Saturday, skies were mostly clear but parts of ZHENGZHOU, China and other cities including Hebi, Xinxiang and Anyang still were under water. In Hebi, rescuers were moving people out of neighborhoods where water was up to two meters (six feet) deep, the Shanghai news outlet The Paper said. the Shanghai news outlet The Paper said authorities intentionally flooded parts of Hebi on Saturday afternoon to lower water levels elsewhere.
