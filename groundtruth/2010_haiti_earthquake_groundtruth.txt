4	JERUSALEM (JTA) — An Israeli army medical and rescue team has set up a field hospital and begun treating earthquake-stricken Haitians. The Israeli field hospital became operational Saturday.
4	At the start of Sunday’s regular Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the Israeli team had already treated hundreds of patients. Israeli medical professionals of IsraAID traveled to the main Port-Au-Prince hospital over the weekend to start treating patients, joining local physicians at the site of the collapsed central hospital where thousands of wounded were seeking help.
M	A search and rescue team from the ZAKA International Rescue Unit on Saturday pulled eight Haitian college students from a collapsed eight-story university building. Tens of thousands of Haitians are believed to be dead following the devastating earthquake of Jan. 12. Israel’s Education Ministry announced Sunday that all of the country’s middle- and high-school students will take part Tuesday in a special online lesson about the Haiti earthquake.

M	On Monday The Lede is continuing to supplement reporting by our colleagues in Haiti on the aftermath of Tuesday’s earthquake by pointing to news and information on the Web. Readers are encouraged to share any first-hand accounts they receive from Haiti or see online in the comments thread below.

4	In response to the Haitian relief effort, Starbucks today committed support and funding to the growing international relief effort. Starting today, participating Starbucks stores in the U.S. and Canada will enable customers to make monetary donations at store registers, with no purchase necessary, to benefit the American and Canadian Red Cross organizations for a limited time. The Starbucks Foundation will also donate $1 million from The Starbucks Foundation to the American Red Cross efforts to help Haiti.
4	[…] In addition, Haitian-American musician Wyclef Jean has collaborated with Starbucks to make an appeal to the Global Community about the crucial needs of the Haitian community. To learn more about Jean’s ongoing efforts in Haiti, go to www.yele.org.
2	Léogane’s police chief, Alain Auguste, says that almost 80% of the town has been destroyed, and that there are at least 10,000 dead. Authorities say they have buried about 1,300 — about 800 in mass graves.
2	Mr. Auguste says Léogane has no heavy equipment like bulldozers or cranes to lift rubble and get to the bodies. “The city is completely destroyed.
2	We have nothing. We work with our hands,” he said.
7	Léogane has practically no communication with national authorities in Port-au-Prince, where most of the aid is arriving. To plead the city’s case, the mayor drove to the capital Saturday.
5	The campus of the nursing college has been turned into a tent city where hundreds of survivors who have lost their houses, or are afraid to sleep in them because of recurring aftershocks, strung sheets between shaved branches of trees under a sweltering sun. “I need antibiotics, I need pain medicine, I need anti-tetanus shots,” says Ms. Alcindor.
5	She fears an outbreak of infection from the filthy conditions. “Those legs we treated Tuesday, they are falling apart,” she says, standing in the middle of the refugee camp.
5	On the death toll, Alain Le Roy said he could not confirm the 200,000 figure and that the U.N. defers to the Red Cross on this matter. He said as far as he knows they have not gone beyond the 50,000 mark and at this point it is still impossible to tell. “I don’t think anybody knows to be frank,” he said.
7	On U.N.-U.S. tensions, Susana Malcorra said there had been coordination problems immediately after the U.S. took over the airport, with priority given to American planes and some U.N. flights — including World Food Program flights packed with food — diverted. But she said since then a special coordination team was set up at the airport itself so that they could talk directly too each other about what was on what planes and that seems to have effectively addressed the issue.
6	I have been told that much U.S. media coverage paints Haiti as a tinderbox ready to explode. I’m told that lead stories in major media are of looting, violence and chaos.
6	There could be nothing further from the truth. I have traveled the entire city daily since my arrival.
2	The extent of damages is absolutely staggering. At every step, at every bend is one horrific tragedy after another; homes, businesses, schools and churches leveled to nothing.
5	Inside every mountain of rubble there are people, most dead at this point. The smell is overwhelming.
6	On every street are people — survivors — who have lost everything they have: homes, parents, children, friends. NOT ONCE have we witnessed a single act of aggression or violence.
6	To the contrary, we have witnessed neighbors helping neighbors and friends helping friends and strangers. We’ve seen neighbors digging in rubble with their bare hands to find survivors.
7	We’ve seen traditional healers treating the injured; we’ve seen dignified ceremonies for mass burials and residents patiently waiting under boiling sun with nothing but their few remaining belongings. A crippled city of two million awaits help, medicine, food and water.
6	Most haven’t received any. Haiti can be proud of its survivors. Their dignity and decency in the face of this tragedy is itself staggering.
6	Periodic roadblocks have been set up by residents, protesting the lack of any aid presence and angry at stench and indecency. Huge state-owned caterpillar tractors and dump trucks were just beginning to arrive and load bodies as we passed through.
5	In the worst parts — every 50 feet or so — there were groups of 10 to 15 bodies lined side by side or stacked together. In between these stacks and groupings is a continual line of singles and doubles — one body after another. The odor is overwhelming.
7	No one sleeps indoors and so roads are also partially blocked with families who have moved their beds to the street. Blocking roads with bodies is what it sometimes takes to get help.
M	They’re not doing it 4 aesthetic reasons. As The Lede noted on Saturday, a group of film students at the Ciné Institute in Jacmel have been producing short video reports on the catastrophic effects of the earthquake in that city of 40,000 on Haiti’s southern coast.
M	Embedded below are three more extraordinary reports from the students in Jacmel. Be warned that both reports contain graphic and very disturbing images of badly wounded or dead people.
7	Bus terminal number one has been bustling like never before, according to Dieumetra Sainmerita, who manages the station’s traffic. He said the cost of bus tickets have risen 20 percent since last week. And people are selling whatever they have left of any value to buy them.
7	“First there were the people who lost there houses,” he said of the passengers. “Then there were people who lost relatives.
6	Now the people I see they are afraid of the thieves trying to steal from them in the night.” Thieves were also on the prowl at the station.
6	Marceson Romen said two men tried to make off with his suitcase, but fled when they saw police. Mr. Romen was on his way to his native Artibone.
7	The 27-year old plumber had left his hometown years ago to go to high school and make a good life for himself. But after pulling his three children out of the rubble that was once their home, he packed them up and hopes to build them a place on the property once occupied by his parents.
7	“I thought one day I would go home a rich man,” he said, carrying one black suitcase and a bar if Irish Spring in his shirt pocket. “Instead I am going back with nothing.”
6	When asked where they were headed, many passengers pointed and said, “The Big North,” which covers Gonaives, Port de Paix, St. Mark, Veret and Cap Haitian. Haitians are survivors & have always been a resilient people. It is wrong to focus on the small group of looters or rioters.
M	Haiti has a long and rich history of contributing to the world. Haiti may be poor economically, but it is rich in history and courage.
M	I don’t know what is more troubling: That so many observers, including political strategist and New Orleans native Donna Brazile, have been drawing facile parallels between the two cities. Or that so many of those comparisons are turning out to be true.
4	Clinton, who is both the UN special envoy to Haiti and a coordinator with fellow former president George W. Bush of a US campaign to raise funds for Haiti, was to meet with Haitian leaders and survivors. As U.N. special envoy for Haiti, I feel a deep obligation to the Haitian people to visit the country and meet with President Préval to ensure our response continues to be coordinated and effective.
M	Le Monde’s front page is given over to an interview with the Haitian novelist, Dany Laferrière, who was in Port-au-Prince at the moment of the earthquake. He wants people to stop talking about Haiti as if it was cursed, suggesting that the island’s population was, in some sense, being punished for a past crime.
6	And he wonders about the identification of those who took food from destroyed shops as “looters”, saying that, when people risk their lives, crawling through ruins in search of something to eat and drink, they are motivated by need, not by greed. It would be better to talk about this incredible energy that I’ve seen, these men and women who are helping each other with courage and dignity.
M	Although the city has been partially destroyed and the state has been decapitated, the people are staying, working and living. So please, stop using the word curse.
M	Haiti has done nothing… This is a catastrophe which could happen anywhere. French-speakers — or those willing to trust Google Translate for a rough idea of what was said — can read the complete interview with Mr. Laferrière on Le Monde’s Web site.
4	Samuel Dalembert, a Haitian basketball player with the Philadelphia 76ers, “will present a check for $100,000 as his initial contribution to Haiti Earthquake Relief,” during a game on Friday, according to a statement by his foundation. The statement continues, “Samuel has also pledged to match any donations made by fans during the game. Representatives from Samuel’s charitable partner UNICEF will also be present to detail the efforts on the ground in Haiti in response to the tragedy.
4	Please consider making your own donation today.” Mr. Dalembert also worked with UNICEF to help in the relief effort after a series of deadly hurricanes struck Haiti in 2008.
2	On Sunday, TV Globo in Brazil broadcast video shot by a Brazilian peacekeeper in Port-au-Prince on Tuesday just moments after the earthquake struck. The footage, in the report below, shows the ruined Sacré Coeur de Tugeau.
3	According to TV Globo, Zilda Arns, a Catholic relief worker who had been compared to Mother Teresa for her work on behalf of children, was killed in the church. Zilda Arns was in Haiti to support the local volunteers of the Pastoral da Criança (Children’s Pastoral), a group she founded in southern Brazil in 1983.
4	The group teaches uneducated mothers the importance of healthcare issues such as breast feeding, vaccinations and proper hydration, and then instructs them how to pass on that knowledge to friends and neighbors in Brazil’s most impoverished communities. Today, the Pastoral is one of Brazil’s most respected organisations and Arns was one of the nation’s best-known faces. Brazil has played a large role in the peacekeeping operation in Haiti and TV Globo reported on Sunday that at least 18 Brazilians died as a result of the earthquake.
7	Complaints about the response of Haiti’s government were echoed early on Monday morning by Richard Morse, a Haitian-American musician who runs the Hotel Oloffson in Port-au-Prince, where many international journalists are now staying. Since soon after the earthquake struck, Mr. Morse has used his Twitter feed — @RAMhaiti — to provide a stream of updates and commentary on the response of Haitians. I’m back… took time to find gas for the generator… journalists were freaking out.
7	The Oloffson is “RED ZONE” How can the UN help the people of Carrefour Feuille if they are prohibited from coming to the neighborhood!! If the UN can’t help poor people then what are they doing in Haiti!!!
7	The UN has odd politics about where they go and what they do. They ignored the corruption during both elections last year.
7	I went to the so called Red Zone on foot with the CBS crew so they could get a close up look at the destruction; smell the bodies If the UN can’t go to where THE PEOPLE need their help then what are they doing here? If the UN can’t gain the trust of the Haitians after four years then what are they doing here?
7	Carrefour Feuille is a zone of destruction The fact that I haven’t seen an international presence in this area tell me that others are following the lead of the UN The UN not permitted in this neighborhood.
6	I have so many journalist here they sleep on the lawn. None of them are armed!!! Safe?
4	Violence is at as minimum considering the current state of desperation, hunger, thirst, lack of medical attention. The U.S. Southern Command said some 2,200 Marines with heavy equipment to clear debris, medical aid and helicopters, would join some 5,000 U.S. troops already in the region.
M	Given the complicated role America has played in Haiti in the past, experts on the region are asking “whether the United States will maintain a muscular role in the reconstruction of Haiti once the news cameras go home,” my colleagues Helene Cooper and Mark Landler report. Haitian political culture has a long history of insularity, corruption, and violence, which partly explains why Port-au-Prince lies in ruins. If, after an earthquake that devastated rich and poor neighborhoods alike, Haiti’s political and business élites resurrect the old way of fratricidal self-seeking, they will find nothing but debris for spoils.
M	Disasters on this scale reveal something about the character of the societies in which they occur. The aftermath of the 2008 cyclone in Burma not only betrayed the callous indifference of the ruling junta but demonstrated the vibrancy of civil society there.
M	Haiti’s earthquake shows that, whatever the communal spirit of its people at the moment of crisis, the government was not functioning, unable even to bury the dead, much less rescue the living. This vacuum, which had been temporarily filled by the U.N., now poses the threat of chaos.
M	But if Haiti is to change, the involvement of outside countries must also change. Rather than administering aid almost entirely through the slow drip of private organizations, international agencies and foreign powers should put their money and their effort into the more ambitious project of building a functional Haitian state. It would be the work of years, and billions of dollars.
M	If this isn’t a burden that nations want to take on, so be it. But to patch up a dying country and call it a rescue would leave Haiti forsaken indeed, and not by God.
4	According to a spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean quoted by The Miami Herald, passengers on the Independence “gave a standing ovation” when they heard that the cruise ship was bringing emergency food supplies with the tourists to Labadee. There were also other rescues in Port-au-Prince on Sunday. As my colleagues Damien Cave and Deborah Sontag reported, a 7-year-old girl who survived more than four days eating dried fruit rolls in the collapsed Caribbean Supermarket was pulled from the rubble in the city’s Delmas neighborhood.

4	At the service, a visibly emotional Mr Mulet read a message from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon: "To you I say: we are with you in spirit. To those no longer with us I say: we will never forget you."
0	Later, Mr Mulet told the BBC that all of Haiti's recent development had been undone. "I think this is going to take many more decades than only 10 years and this is an enormous backwards step in Haiti's development. We will not have to start from zero but from below zero," he said.
4	The UN's assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations, who is acting head of mission in Haiti, described the logistics of the relief operation as a "nightmare", but said those involved were still managing to improve their capacity to provide the help needed. "All this is coming together right now," he said. "Every day you can see more and more Haitian national police on the ground, working with our troops and more and more water being distributed, so it's a matter of time and putting all these elements together."
4	He said areas around Port-au-Prince were being prepared for the creation of tented settlements for the homeless currently living in makeshift camps. Edmond Mulet said all of Haiti's recent development had been undone The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) was working with UN and Brazilian engineers at one site near Croix-des-Bouquets that would house around 30,000 people, and four other sites had been identified, he added.
4	Mr Mulet said 200,000 heavy-duty tents had been ordered to cope with Haiti's rainy season, which typically begins in May, and its hurricane season, which is expected to start around June. "Of course, 200,000 family-sized tents - solid ones that can withstand a hurricane season - are not available in the market just like that, so they have to be made. It's going to take a few days and weeks before they can arrive, but all this is coming," he added. Haitian President Rene Preval earlier this week called for the urgent airdrop of 200,000 more tents and 26 million ready-to-eat meals before the rainy season begins.

4	US President Obama promised $100 million for the relief effort in Haiti on Thursday morning,vowing that the United States would stand with the impoverished nation as it counted what could be tens of thousands of dead and grappled with the devastation of the Tuesday earthquake. Within Haiti and beyond,the driving urgency of the last 36 hours was only growing.
5	The main morgue in Port-au-Prince was completely full,and hundreds of bodies were piled up outside and abandoned. The dead included some people who had been waiting on the grounds of an adjacent hospital in vain attempts to get treatment. When they died,their bodies were simply dragged to the morgue.
7	Foreign aid workers trying to deliver supplies faced a logistical nightmare. Power was still out,telecommunications rarely functioning. Most medical facilities had been severely damaged.
7	Supplies of food and fresh water dwindling. Ships could not bring their cargos of supplies into Haitis damaged port; roads were blocked not only by debris but by people with no safe shelter to retreat to.
4	Flights were limited at Port-au-Princes airport. Still,airplanes loaded with rescuers and search teams,food and medical supplies were landing,and supplies were filtering in from the Dominican Republic.
4	In interviews with American television stations,Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the US was working as fast as possible to move aid to Haiti. She said helping the country rebuild from the quake would be a long-term effort. Haitis
3	President,René Préval,called the death toll unimaginable as,in the first 24 hours of the quake,he surveyed the wreckage,which included his own residence,the presidential palace. As of Wednesday,the UN confirmed that 16 peacekeepers had been killed and as many as 200 workers were missing,including the chief of its mission,Hédi Annabi.
5	The citys Archbishop,Msgr Joseph Serge Miot,was feared dead. Please save my baby! Jeudy Francia,a woman in her 20s,shrieked outside the St-Esprit Hospital in the city on Wednesday.
7	Her child,a girl about four years old,writhed in pain in the hospitals chaotic courtyard,near where a handful of bodies lay under white blankets. A Red Cross field team of officials from several nations had to spend Wednesday night in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic to gather its staff before taking the six-hour drive in the morning across the border to the earthquake zone.
4	We were on the plane here with a couple of different agencies,and they all are having similar challenges of access, Colin Chaperon,a field director for the American Red Cross,said in a telephone interview. Aid agencies said they would open their storehouses of food and water in Haiti,and the World Food Program was flying in nearly 100 tonnes of ready-to-eat meals and high-energy biscuits from El Salvador.

4	PORTO PRÍNCIPE - Com o governo do Haiti e a cúpula da Missão de Estabilização das Nações Unidas
7	no país inoperantes por conta dos terremotos - que destruíram praticamente todos os prédios do governo (de ministérios, hospitais a agências de identificação civil) e o prédio-sede da ONU, que funcionava no Hotel Christopher - o país mergulhou num desgoverno que interfere diretamente na distribuição de alimentos e remédios. O Estado-Maior dos 17 países que compõem as tropas de paz não consegue estabelecer um plano conjunto de ação para atender a uma população desesperada por comida, água, assistência médica e energia.
M	Os EUA, que controlam o aeroporto, estão sendo acusados de priorizar seus próprios interesses, e no sábado, a secretária de Estado, Hillary Clinton, defendeu mais poderes aos americanos. O presidente do Haiti, René Préval, fez um dramático apelo no sábado para que os esforços de ajuda sejam mais bem coordenados e para que não haja discussões entre os países doadores. - Esta é uma situação extremamente difícil.
M	Devemos nos manter tranquilos para coordená-la, e não nos acusarmos - afirmou Préval a repórteres, depois de se reunir com autoridades de vários países. O apelo foi feito depois que o ministro da Cooperação da França, Alain Joyandet, afirmou à imprensa ter entregue uma queixa oficial na Embaixada dos EUA. A pedido de Préval, os americanos assumiram a coordenação dos trabalhos no aeroporto local, parcialmente destruído pelo tremor, mas vêm sendo acusados de priorizar o pouso e a decolagem de suas aeronaves. Segundo Joyandet, a dois aviões franceses foram negadas permissões de pouso.
7	Um deles, levava um hospital de campanha - uma das mais urgentes necessidades da população. O Programa Mundial de Alimentos da ONU também reclamou do acesso ao aeroporto. Segundo seus representantes, tentou-se pousar aviões carregados de alimentos, remédios e água na quinta e na sexta-feira sem sucesso.
4	Um funcionário da agência afirmou que a prioridade de pouso foi para voos dos EUA levando equipamentos e, de decolagem, para cidadãos americanos que deixavam o país. Aviões brasileiros também teriam sido impedidos de pousar. Além disso, o fato de americanos assumirem o controle do aeroporto teria melindrado autoridades brasileiras, uma vez que o país comanda as tropas de paz da ONU no Haiti.

4	Le navire militaire français Francis Garnier, un bâtiment de transport et ravitaillement léger, a quitté aujourd'hui à 13h30 locales (18H30 à Paris) le port de Fort-de-France, avec 100 tonnes de fret et 60 militaires de l'armée de terre à destination de Haïti. Le bateau transportant 6 camions, une ambulance, des 4/4, trois pelles mécaniques, de la nourriture, de l'eau en bouteille et du carburant va faire escale dans 11h00 à la Guadeloupe pour embarquer encore des engins de chantier, des tentes, du matériel humanitaire et de la nourriture, a indiqué le capitaine de corvette, qui commende le bateau, Frédéric Petitjean.
4	Le navire, qui dispose de 50 hommes d'équipage, n'a pas besoin de quai pour décharger car il peut se poser sur une plage, atteindra Haïti dans 4 jours, a précisé le capitaine. Les 60 militaires, puissamment armés, ont pour mission d'assurer la sécurité des sauveteurs qui recherchent les victimes du séisme de mardi. Un autre navire, le navire Sirocco, actuellement à Dakar, se rendra également en Haïti, équipé en particulier de "deux plateaux de chirurgie", avait annoncé hier le président Sarkozy.

M	O ministro de Relações Institucionais, Alexandre Padilha, confirmou nesta quinta-feira que o Poder Executivo enviará em breve um
0	projeto de lei ao Congresso Nacional para estabelecer indenizações às famílias dos militares brasileiros mortos durante o terremoto que se abateu sobre o Haiti na última semana.
0	Um programa de apoio aos filhos menores de idade de cada soldado também deverá constar da proposta que a Presidência da República irá submeter aos parlamentares. Os valores da compensação aos familiares e que tipo de suporte será ofertado aos filhos dos militares ainda estão sendo definidos pelo governo. "O presidente (...) deve encaminhar um projeto de lei ao Congresso Nacional que autoriza não só indenização imediata, mas uma forma de garantir apoio aos filhos dos militares", disse o coordenador político do governo.
4	Além da indenização, o presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva irá encaminhar ao Congresso Nacional uma medida provisória (MP) que garante a liberação total de R$ 375 milhões para um pacote de ajuda à população do Haiti. Dos recursos federais a serem liberados, R$ 135 milhões serão destinados para que o Ministério da Saúde possa construir unidades de pronto atendimento (UPA) médico para a população haitiana. De acordo com Alexandre Padilha, além dos recursos para as UPAs, haverá US$ 15 milhões em doações diretas ao Haiti (US$ 5 milhões já depositados na conta da Organização das Nações Unidas) frutos de um pacote de R$ 35 milhões separados para o
4	Ministério de Relações Exteriores, além de recursos adicionais no valor de R$ 205 milhões para o
4	Ministério da Defesa financiar o custo de tropas militares, entre outros gastos.
0	Um terremoto de magnitude 7 na escala Richter atingiu o Haiti no último dia 12, às 16h53 no horário local (19h53 em Brasília). Com epicentro a 15 km da capital, Porto Príncipe, segundo o Serviço Geológico Norte-Americano, o terremoto é considerado pelo órgão o mais forte a atingir o país nos últimos 200 anos.
2	Dezenas de prédios da capital caíram e deixaram moradores sob escombros. Importantes edificações foram atingidas, como prédios das Nações Unidas
5	e do governo do país. Estimativas mais recentes do governo haitiano falam em mais de 200 mil mortos e 75 mil corpos já enterrados.
X	O Haiti é o país mais pobre do continente americano. A fundadora e coordenadora internacional da Pastoral da Criança, Organismo de Ação Social da Conferência Nacional dos Bispos do Brasil (CNBB), Zilda Arns, o diplomata Luiz Carlos da Costa, segunda maior autoridade civil da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) no Haiti, uma menina com nacionalidades brasileira e francesa, adotada por uma família europeia, que não teve nome e idade divulgados, e pelo menos 18 militares brasileiros da missão de paz da ONU morreram durante o terremoto.
4	O ministro da Defesa, Nelson Jobim, e comandantes do Exército chegaram na noite de quarta-feira à base brasileira no país para liderar os trabalhos do contingente militar brasileiro no Haiti.
4	O Ministério das Relações Exteriores do Brasil anunciou que o país enviará até US$ 15 milhões para ajudar a reconstruir o país. Além dos recursos financeiros, o Brasil doará 28 t de alimentos e água para a população do país.
4	A Força Aérea Brasileira (FAB) disponibilizou oito aeronaves de transporte para ajudar as vítimas. O Brasil chefia a missão de paz da ONU no país (Missão das Nações Unidas para a Estabilização no Haiti, ou Minustah, na sigla em francês), que conta com cerca de 7 mil integrantes. Segundo o Ministério da Defesa, 1.266 militares brasileiros servem na força. Ao todo, são 1.310 brasileiros no Haiti. A missão de paz foi criada em 2004, depois que o então presidente Jean-Bertrand Aristide foi deposto durante uma rebelião.
2	Além do prédio da ONU, o prédio da Embaixada Brasileira em Porto Príncipe também ficou danificado, mas segundo o governo, não há vítimas entre os funcionários brasileiros.

4	Op radio en televisie wordt donderdag een inzamelingsactie gehouden voor Haïti.
4	Aan de actie doen de publieke en de commerciële omroepen mee. Later op de avond wordt bekendgemaakt hoeveel geld is ingezameld.
4	Voorzitter Farah Karimi van de (SHO): "Er is veel geld nodig, niet alleen voor de noodhulp nu maar juist ook voor de wederopbouw in de jaren daarna". De coördinatie rond de uitzending wordt verzorgd door NOS Evenementen. Onder de noemer Radio 555 werken 3FM, Radio 2, de Wereldomroep en de commerciële radiozenders donderdag van zes uur 's ochtends tot 's avonds negen uur samen om geld
4	op te halen voor de slachtoffers van de aardbeving in Haïti. Zaterdag werd bekend dat op gironummer 555 al 3,3 miljoen euro is gestort.

1	A new earthquake jolted Port-au-Prince yesterday, sending people fleeing on to the streets and complicating relief efforts as the US dispatched another 4,000 troops to Haiti. A magnitude 5.9 quake, the most ­powerful aftershock since the 12 ­January cataclysm, rattled ruins in the capital and sowed panic but caused no serious reported damage or casualties. Seismologists said the epicentre was about 35 miles south-west of the city and the focus was six miles deep.
1	They warned of possible stronger aftershocks to come as the earth adjusted to new stresses caused by the original quake. "Sometimes [they] die out very quickly. In other cases they can go on for weeks, or if we're really unlucky it could go on for months," Bruce Pressgrave, of the US Geological Survey, told AP.
X	The dawn quake lasted about eight seconds, produced clouds of dust and sent people screaming from shelters. One woman with a heart condition died from fright.
X	Others simply slept through it. The government said it would send a response team to Petit-Goave, near the epicentre, where seven buildings reportedly collapsed. "We know they are going to need some help," said the prime minister, Jean-Max Bellerive.
7	Combined with drizzle which has compacted debris, the tremor compounded the multiple difficulties of teams seeing survivors and corpses buried amid semi-collapsed structures. The quake killed an estimated 200,000 people, injured 250,000 and left 1.5 ­million homeless, according to the EU.
4	US dominance of the relief effort was likely to increase with a decision by the Pentagon to send another 2,000 US marines to Haiti, diverting troops that were on their way to the Gulf and Africa, to bolster the 12,000 already on the ground and on ships offshore. Navy officials said yesterday that the three-ship USS Nassau amphibious ready group left port on Monday for its regular deployment but has been told to go Haiti instead for the earthquake relief effort. The group is picking up marines in North Carolina and will include 2,000 sailors and 2,000 marines when it gets under way for Haiti, perhaps as early as today.
4	The first group of some 2,000 marines already off Haiti's shore went on land for the first time Tuesday to help deliver aid. A Pentagon official says there are some 11,500 US military personnel in Haiti or offshore and 16,000 are expected by week's end. The first US Humvees were seen in Port-au-Prince on Tuesday.
M	Last week Hugo Chávez of Venezuela and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, both leftist presidents, accused Washington of masking imperialism as aid. Haiti has welcomed the Americans but today turned down an offer of 800 troops from the Dominican Republic, according to western diplomats because of historic tension between the neighbours.
M	A separate criticism of the international response came from aid agencies who called for an urgent moratorium on all adoptions from Haiti, saying that taking children out of the country at present risked causing long-term damage to already vulnerable children. Thirteen agencies working together in the UK under the umbrella of the Disasters Emergency Committee said tonight that many children apparently orphaned by the quake will have surviving relatives, and that efforts should instead be concentrated on reuniting families. Unicef and SOS Children, the world's largest orphan charity, also cautioned against hasty plans for large-scale adoption.
M	Miami's Catholic church has declared plans to fly hundreds of children to a new life in the US, while Edward Rendell, the governor of Pennsylvania, flew to Port-au-Prince to evacuate 54 orphans from the city after being told by Haiti's ambassador to the US that his presence could cut through red tape. A party of Dutch social workers and immigration officials landed in Haiti earlier this week to evacuate 100 children whose adoptions were already under way, while the US has waived visa requirements for Haitian children already going through the process and Canada is also fast-tracking adoptions.
M	Jasmine Whitbread, Save the Children's chief executive, said: "The vast majority of the children currently on their own still have family members alive who will be desperate to be reunited with them and will be able to care for them with the right support. Save the Children has teams in Haiti working on identifying lone children and tracing family members.
M	World Vision's chief executive, Justin Byworth, said a wave of adoptions could leave children vulnerable to trafficking and abuse. Adoptions already in progress should go ahead, argued the agencies, as long as they conformed to local and international law.
7	Living conditions for survivors remained dire and though fewer bodies were visible the stench of death hung over Port-au-Prince. Food, water and medical care seemed marginally more plentiful on Port-au-Prince's streets.
4	"Supplies are beginning to get out to the people," the US defence secretary, Robert Gates, said during a visit to India. Banks are due to reopen shortly and some money transfer agencies are already functioning.

4	A medical group today said one of its planes was turned away from Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, despite guarantees given by the UN and the US defence department. Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) received no explanation as to why the cargo plane carrying an inflatable surgical hospital was blocked from landing yesterday and re-routed to Samana, in the Dominican Republic. All material from the cargo is now being sent by truck from Samana, but this has added a 24-hour delay.
4	A second MSF plane is on its way and scheduled to land today in Port- au-Prince at around 10am local time (3pm GMT) with additional lifesaving medical material and the rest of the equipment for the hospital. If this plane is also rerouted the installation of the hospital will be further delayed, in a situation where thousands of wounded are still in need of life-saving treatment, the group said.
4	"Priority must be given immediately to planes carrying life-saving equipment and medical personnel," a spokesperson said. The inflatable hospital includes two operating theatres, an intensive care unit, 100-bed capacity, an emergency room and all the necessary equipment needed for sterilising material.
5	MSF teams are working around the clock in five hospitals in Port-au-Prince, but only two operating threatres are fully functional, while a third has been improvised for minor surgery due to the massive influx of wounded. MSF doctors say they have never seen so many serious injuries as those sustained by victims of Haiti's earthquake. Surgical units set up by Médecins sans Frontières in Port-au-Prince have been working around the clock to treat large numbers of patients. The most serious cases have involved caesarian sections and amputations.
4	The group has relocated to Chocsal hospital in the Cité Soleil district after its original facilities at Martissant were badly damaged. The new operating theatre has been working non-stop since early on Friday.
4	In Trinite, MSF teams are treating people under canvas in the grounds of a clinic damaged by the earthquake, which is believed to have killed between 100,000 and 200,000 people. In Carrefour, a badly hit district, MSF's two operating theatres have been besieged by patients. MSF said it was struggling to find more buildings it could use but efforts were continuing to get more medical staff and supplies into the country.
7	The major obstacle remains the bottleneck at the airport, which has turned away a number of vital cargo flights. "Lack of authorisation to land at the airport has already caused a 24-hour delay to the planned arrival of MSF's much needed inflatable hospital," the group said.
6	Like the UN and other relief agencies, MSF had workers who were caught up in the earthquake. It is still trying to confirm the whereabouts of others and is increasingly concerned about their welfare. MSF teams say the lack of food and water is contributing to tension in the city. There has been little sign of significant aid distribution and there are increasing reports of looting, although not yet accompanied by violence.

4	WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Haiti gave the United States control of its main airport on Friday to bring order in the skies to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the quake-traumatized Caribbean nation, the Obama administration said.
4	U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters that Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive signed a memorandum of understanding formally transferring operations at Toussaint L’Ouverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince. “Obviously we will assume this responsibility as long as it’s appropriate and to the point where the Haitian government is able and ready to resume that capability,” Crowley said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was due to visit Haiti on Saturday.
M	The modest airport became a bottleneck almost immediately after Tuesday’s devastation as the world rushed help to the impoverished nation. Regional authorities believe as many as 200,000 people were killed in the quake.
4	Waves of military and civilian planes loaded with food and water, medicine, and rescue crews poured into the small Haitian air space but many flights circled for hours before landing or were diverted. While a 9,000-foot runway can handle the biggest jetliners arriving “heavy” with cargo and the tarmac escaped serious damage, the Port-au-Prince airport was compromised by a severely damaged control tower and limited facilities for dealing with the relief effort. The U.S. Air Force landed on Wednesday and immediately worked with Haitian authorities and a team from the Federal Aviation Administration to restore navigation and communications capabilities. They also sorted planes on the ground and began to organize arrivals.
7	But Haitian air space remained off limits through Friday to many flights approaching from overseas with little notice. Some planes bound for Haiti were diverted to the Dominican Republic and airports in Florida, the FAA said.
7	Aviation authorities were concerned that long approach delays could jeopardize onboard fuel supplies. Further complicating matters, the Port-au-Prince airport ran out of fuel, meaning any planes that landed would not be able to refuel for departure.
4	U.S. President Barack Obama said the United States, and countries including Brazil, Mexico, Canada, France, Colombia, Russia, Japan, and Britain managed to fly in rescue and logistics personnel and supplies. While some aid was getting in, the White House hoped improved logistics would streamline and accelerate the effort. On Friday night, a ban was lifted on most flights heading for saturated Haitian air space.
4	It was replaced by a two-tier approach for managing traffic that was worked out by international aviation authorities and Caribbean states. Working with Haitian authorities, a team of U.S. military and civilian aviation experts began prioritizing arriving flights based on what was needed most on the ground. A second team based at a U.S. military facility in Florida lined up airborne flights for arrival. Pilots are required to file a flight plan before departure and obtain a landing time.
X	The window is open for 40 minutes - 20 minutes before scheduled arrival and 20 minutes after, an FAA advisory said. Commercial flights have been banned since Tuesday. U.S. carriers serving Haiti include American Airlines and Spirit Airlines. American had been scheduled to fly in relief supplies.

M	PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) -
7	Haiti’s voodoo priests are objecting to anonymous mass burials as an improper way to handle the tens of thousands of dead from the earthquake -- and have taken their complaint to President Rene Preval. Dumping the dead in hurriedly excavated mass graves without proper rites is seen as desecration in a country where many believe in zombies -- dead bodies brought back to life by supernatural forces who could persecute the living.
5	Haitian officials say so far at least 50,000 bodies have been dumped in mass graves outside the shattered capital, Port-au-Prince, in what they view as the most efficient way to dispose of the fast-rotting corpses from Tuesday’s disaster. “It is not in our culture to bury people in such a fashion,” Haiti’s main voodoo leader, Max Beauvoir, said in a meeting with Preval.
M	Local radio is broadcasting messages for Haitians to put bodies recovered from under the rubble of collapsed buildings on the street for collection by garbage and other trucks. “The conditions in which bodies are being buried is not respecting the dignity of these people,” Beauvoir, who was educated at City College of New York and the Sorbonne in Paris, said in the Preval meeting this weekend.
6	More than half of Haiti’s 9 million people are believed to practice voodoo, a religion with roots in Africa. Some 80 percent also are Catholic and most Haitians see no conflict between the two. Five days after the earthquake, scores of untouched corpses, now bloated and stinking, remain on streets.
X	Red Cross officials have repeatedly said no one should fear disease from dead bodies after the earthquake that is believed to have killed up to 200,000 people. On Sunday, more bodies appeared overnight, with locals saying they were thieves burned and shot by lynch-mobs, gangs and police. They said about 20 people were killed like that.

4	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI -- Medical teams struggled to cope with an overwhelming crush of injured patients in this earthquake-ravaged city Sunday, while an international armada of would-be helpers vied in frustration for access to the disaster zone. The French-based group Doctors Without Borders issued a public call that its planes "be allowed to land" at the Port-au-Prince international airport, "in order to treat thousands of wounded waiting for vital surgical operations."
7	In North Carolina, troops with the 82nd Airborne who have been ready to deploy since Friday were told it would be at least 9 p.m. before they leave, because the tarmac is clogged with too many planes. Top State Department and military officials on the ground in Haiti said their ability to quickly get vital food and water in Haitians' hands has been hampered by their reliance on Port-au-Prince's tiny airport.
7	Because of damaged roads and a devastated port, an airfield that typically serves three flights a day and lacks electricity and a functioning tower is having to handle up to 60 civilian flights a day. The airport has been swarmed by incoming flights carrying emergency relief items from many nations, and some officials and organizations have been angered that the U.S. military took over prioritizing which flights it considered the most important to gain entry.
M	After the complaint from Doctors Without Borders, its hospital plane was given clearance to land around 3 p.m. Sunday. An Air Force official said the military had 67 civilian flights trying to arrive Saturday, and turned away only three.
5	At a field hospital run by the University of Miami in a United Nation's compound outside the Port-au-Prince airport, workers set up cots on an outdoor patio to accommodate waves of sick and wounded who could not fit into the already overflowing surgical and medical tents. Since Wednesday night, the staff at the field hospital has grown from three doctors to 87 personnel. On Sunday, they were treating 280 patients crammed into a large tent on side-by-side cots.
5	Next door was the surgery tent. On the patio, patients hooked up to intravenous lines filled the rows of new cots as soon as they were in place.
M	Seven field hospitals had been set up in Port-au-Prince by international organizations as of Saturday, and three more were supposed to open Sunday, said Nicholas Reader, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. While some Haitian hospitals were still functioning, they were facing a new challenge -- patients and their families who refused to leave once they were treated because they had no other shelter available.

X	They built the roadblock across the highway out of whatever they could find -- burning tires, the shell of a refrigerator, a rusty bed frame, a palm tree stump, a beaten-up camper shell and eight bodies, one in a makeshift coffin, another stuffed into a suitcase. The young men of the Carrefour suburb of Port-au-Prince then furiously interrogated drivers Saturday about what they were carrying in their cars.
X	They were sick of people from the earthquake-wrecked capital dumping the dead on their streets in the middle of the night. Roadblocks are common in Haiti, ranging in mood from tense civil disobedience to outright violence. Saturday’s played out over two hours in a way that demonstrated, in almost perfect form, the dynamics of power in the country and even highlighted Haitians’ troubled love of Americans. On a hot and cloudless morning, diesel exhaust and a fine cement powder cast a gray haze over the rutted strip of Route 2, a crucial artery out of Port-au-Prince lined by crumbling cinder-block storefronts.
X	Patron Wilfrenz, 28, said the young men who set up the roadblock were part of the “local brigade,” which protects the neighborhood in the absence of any meaningful law enforcement presence. Such groups, under a variety of names and with varying amounts of weaponry, were empowered by populist former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. They are seen as either freedom fighters or street gangs, depending on one’s point of view.
X	They have repeatedly shut down the country, most notably during the events leading up to Aristide’s ouster in 2004 and the subsequent election in 2006. Although they have been quiet lately, no one believes that they cannot mobilize in an instant. On Saturday, about 20 of the young men, with more than a hundred others watching, became gatekeepers to the entire southern part of the country.
7	Around 9 a.m., a contingent of United Nations peacekeepers prepared to break up the roadblock. The Sri Lankan soldiers, based in the nearby rural town of Leogane, pulled their trucks right up to the barrier of corpses and junk.
7	Eight of the blue helmets, armed with assault rifles, got out and screamed back and forth with the unarmed men about removing it. Drivers on both sides of the roadblock agreed with the peacekeepers.
7	“Let it through!” shouted a man driving a truck. Someone dragged away the camper shell. Another man ran up and shoved it back.
7	“Block it off!” he yelled.
7	The eight soldiers moved in with their rifles about 9:30 a.m., barking and gesturing to get the roadblock out of the way. They eventually kicked the camper shell aside, and a few cars and U.N. vehicles got through.
7	Then the local brigade moved it back. The eight peacekeepers stood about 20 feet away looking perplexed and a bit concerned.
7	One talked on a radio. Another snapped a picture with his camera.
6	Two U.S. Navy helicopters circled overhead. There was much furious screaming and gesturing between the brigade and drivers. They didn’t search the cars or trucks, but they did take cash.
6	Those who paid got through. A Toyota Land Cruiser blasted through, and ended up pushing the palm tree trunk away. The young men stopped the SUV and recovered the stump.
4	The posturing and yelling and slipping of cash went on until about 10:15, when the two U.S. helicopters flew in low, approaching to land. The crowd began to run, but not away.
4	Hundreds poured across the highway and down a rutted dirt road to a rocky field along the shore, where a collapsed blue sloop listed in the surf. The prop wash from the landing choppers kicked up grit and small rocks.
4	The people kept running. They piled up at each copter door as the rotors wound down, grabbing and shouting words that the crews surely didn’t understand.
4	The Americans didn’t fly off, or open fire. They handed out boxes of bottled water.
4	When they had finished, they told everyone to back away, which they did, and flew off. “They came to save our lives,” said Golen Parveles, a stout man in a faded golf shirt.
M	Americans have had a rough relationship with Haiti since the mountainous French colony became the second free republic in the New World after the United States. In modern history, Washington supported the brutal dictatorship of the Duvaliers as part of its Cold War chess game.
M	And three U.S. administrations -- those of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush -- took an inconsistent approach to Aristide and the army and paramilitaries who successively ousted him. Still, Haiti’s hopes are always aimed at the U.S. “After God, we believe in America,” said Charles Anes Adams, 34, gratefully drinking some of his water under a mango tree.

6	Haiti's government says about 230,000 people died in last month's earthquake, 18,000 more than its previous estimate.
4	The toll from the 12 January quake is approaching that of the 2004 Asian tsunami, which killed 250,000 people. Communications Minister Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue said the toll was not definitive. About 300,000 were injured. But later, Interior Minister Paul Bien-Aime issued a slightly different total, saying the "verified" death toll was "more than 217,000". The latest figure does not include bodies buried by private funeral homes in private cemeteries, or the dead buried by their own families. The one-month anniversary of the catastrophic quake is to be marked with prayer vigils and fasting. A BBC correspondent in the capital Port-au-Prince says there is increasing concern that with the rainy season approaching, the lack of tents and temporary shelter could lead to the outbreak of disease.
M	In the biggest of the camps that sprang up in the city after the earthquake, people are still living under sheeting strung across wooden poles. Aid agency officials said there was a plan to get thousands of the most vulnerable homeless people into tents ahead of the rains. But the challenges of putting large numbers of tents in the crowded camps are considerable. There were reports on Tuesday that a damaged supermarket had collapsed while people were inside. Rescue teams, which had been retrieving bodies of quake victims from the site, tried to remove the debris to reach an estimated five to eight people trapped underneath - said to have been looters - but eventually gave up the search, AFP news agency reported.

4	PROTESTS over the slow arrival of aid have flared in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince as Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive put the earthquake death toll at more than 200,000. More than three weeks after the 7.0-magnitude quake, Mr Bellerive said 300,000 injured had been treated, 250,000 homes had been destroyed and 30,000 businesses lost.
6	After a tense night when shots were fired in the ruined capital, about 300 people gathered outside the mayor's office in the once-upscale Petionville neighbourhood on Wednesday. '' If the police fire on us, we are going to set things ablaze,'' shouted one protester, raising a cement block above his head. Another 200 protesters marched to the US embassy, crying out for food and aid, while about 50 demonstrators gathered outside the police headquarters where the government of President Rene Preval is temporarily installed.

4	"America is moving forward with one of the largest relief efforts in its history," Mr Obama said, while warning that recovery would take a long time. President Bush urged Americans to send "cash", and President Clinton said Haitians "can escape their history and built a better future if we do our part".
7	A spokeswoman for the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said aid workers were dealing with a disaster "like no other" in UN memory because the country had been "decapitated". "Government buildings have collapsed and we do not even have the support of the local infrastructure," Elisabeth Byrs said in Geneva.
7	Ms Byrs said the situation was even worse than the devastation wrought by the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia's Aceh province. "It's worse than the Indonesian earthquake where at least we could get the support of some local authorities," she said.
4	Displaced people The UN has launched an appeal for $562m (£346m) intended to help three million people for six months. Satellite and close-up images of Port-au-Prince devastation But while aid may be arriving in huge quantities but there is little of sign of a co-ordinated aid effort on the ground, correspondents say.
M	Many people continue to leave the city, in search of food, water and medicine. The UN is reporting a rise in the number of people trying to cross into the neighbouring Dominican Republic, and an influx into Haiti's northern cities.
2	Meanwhile, details are emerging about the extent of the damage beyond Port-au-Prince. Up to 90% of the buildings have been damaged in Leogane, a town about 19km (18 miles) to the west, the UN said.

4	At a collapsed Caribbean Supermarket where search teams from Florida and New York City worked, rescuers late Sunday pulled two survivors from what had been its fourth floor. Officials said both were in stable condition, able to survive for so long by eating food trapped along with them.
4	Earlier in the day, a policeman reported three other people had been rescued from the rubble. Crews had located the pair on Sunday afternoon and worked to get them out, NBC's Kerry Sanders reported from the scene.
M	One official coordinating the rescue efforts there told Sanders that a text message believed sent from under the rubble indicated that "more than 60" people were alive there. Officials later said that number was probably a mistake.
M	The supermarket's manager, Samer Tahmoush, estimated that there would have been around 75 to 100 shoppers inside the market in the Delmas neighborhood when the quake hit. The supermarket, one of the biggest in Port-au-Prince, had completely collapsed on itself, its upper layers falling on those below like a squeezed concertina.
M	Crushed supermarket trolleys were visible between the sandwiched layers of concrete. Also visible were green and orange supermarket shelving and scattered debris and wares like tea bags, cat food, kitchenware, electronic goods and children's toys, toilet rolls and bathroom sponges.
4	"We've had to cut through three floors from above, we've been digging through concrete floors, shelving, food, and everything else you would find in a supermarket," said Jose Mendia from the FEMA Florida rescue team. "It's a really consolidated collapse, what we call a pancake collapse," he added.
4	"The best time to get somebody back is within 96 hours, but if they have access to food and water, they could survive longer," he said. It was believed that some of those trapped deep inside might be able to reach food and water near them.
M	Tahmoush said many of his staff had managed to run out fast enough and escape being buried. Many others too had been pulled out quickly from the rubble by rescuers. But Tahmoush said he knew that a number of his employees — cashiers and bag packers — were buried under the wreckage.
3	In another rescue, a Danish U.N. employee was freed from the destroyed headquarters on Sunday. He was talking and given water before being rushed off for medical treatment.
M	He was found just 15 minutes after U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon visited the scene. And the co-owner of the Hotel Montana was pulled out from under the rubble of what had been a luxury hotel.
4	Nadine Cardoso was dehydrated but otherwise uninjured. Twelve hours after the rescue effort began, with more than 20 friends and relatives of the prominent community member watching early Sunday, Cardoso was lowered from a hill of debris on a stretcher.
4	The rescue was bittersweet for Cardoso's sister, because rescuers also told Gerthe Cardoso they had to abandon a search for her 7-year-old grandson when an aftershock closed a space where he was believed to be. U.N. humanitarian spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs said 1,739 rescue workers in 43 teams with 161 dogs and high-tech equipment so far have saved more than 70 people.
M	The U.N. itself lost at least 40 staff — including its mission chief Hedi Annabi — with hundreds still missing. "For the United Nations, this is the gravest and greatest single loss in the history of our organization," Ban said. He added that the U.N. was already feeding 40,000 and hopes to feed 2 million within a month. For many others, though, the five days since the magnitude-7.0 quake hit have turned into an aching wait for the food, water and medical care slowly making its way from an overwhelmed airport rife with political squabbles.
M	And while aid is reaching the country, growing impatience among the suffering has spawned some violence. Nobody knows how many died in Tuesday's quake.
6	Haiti's government alone has already recovered 20,000 bodies — not counting those recovered by independent agencies or relatives themselves, Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said. Amid the struggle for food, some turned to looting, infuriating people struggling to guard what little they still have. Gunfire crackled in the streets as police battled suspected looters in parts of the city.
6	Officers were seen hurling tear gas canisters, sending crowds running along the rubble-strewn avenues. At least some suspected looters were beaten and shot.
6	Haitians seemed increasingly frustrated by a seemingly invisible government — some setting bonfires in a downtown street to burn the bodies authorities have been unable to remove, leaving passers-by to cover their faces against the smell of burning flesh. Two suspected looters lay on the street in the Delmas neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, both beaten and with their hands bound together.
6	Some in the angry crowd that gathered around them said they had been attacked by angry residents, others that police had caused their wounds. One lay completely motionless, his dreadlocked hair stained by a deep pool of dark crimson blood.
6	The other lay bleeding profusely but occasionally twitched his leg. A few hours later, a reporter found both men were dead.
6	However they got that way — whether vigilante justice or police execution — all agreed that they were criminals who had escaped from the destroyed prison. Aid delivery appeared to be speeding up.
4	Florence Louis, seven months pregnant with two children, was one of thousands of Haitians who gathered at a gate at the Cite Soleil slum, where U.N. World Food Program workers handed out high-energy biscuits for the first time. "It is enough because I didn't have anything at all," said Louis, 29, clutching four packets of biscuits. The Haitian government has established 14 distribution points for food and other supplies, and U.S. Army helicopters scouted locations for more.
4	Aid groups opened five emergency health centers. Vital gear, such as water-purification units, was arriving from abroad. On a hillside golf course, perhaps 50,000 people were sleeping in a makeshift tent city overlooking the stricken capital.
4	Paratroopers of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division flew there Saturday to set up a base for handing out water and food. After the initial frenzy among the waiting crowd, when helicopters could only hover and toss out their cargo, a second flight landed and soldiers passed out some 2,000 military-issue ready-to-eat meals to an orderly line of Haitians. But aid delivery was still bogged down by congestion at the Port-au-Prince airport, quake damage at the seaport, poor roads and the fear of looters and robbers.
7	"Many people are just fleeing to the countryside, they are looking for a place to stay and for food," said Enel Legrand, a 24-year-old Haitian volunteer aid worker. The airport congestion also touched off diplomatic rows between the U.S. military and other donor nations.
7	Doctors Without Borders said Sunday that a cargo plane carrying a field hospital was denied permission to land at the airport and had to be rerouted through the Dominican Republic — creating a 24-hour delay in setting up a crucial field hospital. France and Brazil both lodged official complaints that the U.S. military, in control of the international airport, had denied landing permission to relief flights from their countries.
4	As relief teams grappled with on-the-ground obstacles, U.S. leadership promised Saturday to step up aid efforts. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited and pledged more American assistance.
4	President Barack Obama met with former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton in Washington and urged Americans to donate to Haiti relief efforts. Former President Clinton on Sunday announced that he would travel to Haiti on Monday.
4	In Port-au-Prince, hundreds of Haitians simply dropped to their knees outside a warehouse when workers for the agency Food for the Poor announced they would distribute rice, beans and other supplies. "They started praying right then and there," said project director Clement Belizaire. Children and the elderly were asked to step first into line, and some 1,500 people got food, soap and rubber sandals until supplies ran out, he said.

0	Late afternoon, Tuesday 12 January, the Caribbean.
0	The sun is subsiding in the west, and, for some, it's lazy time. On his terrace in Santiago de Cuba, Eduardo Machin is sitting on a lounger, and down at the United States base on Guantanamo Bay, it's towards the end of a nothing-special kind of day. Some 160 miles across the sea, soldiers are patrolling more purposefully.
4	They're part of the 11,000-strong United Nations force whose task is to bring some semblance of stability to Haiti, the land of voodoo, gang-law dictators and poverty so dire that three-quarters of these, the poorest people in the Western hemisphere, live on less than £1.30 a day. Yet, street by street, bit by corrupted bit, small victories are being won by the UN and aid agencies.
M	And that's why, as the sun dips a little lower, and the clocks in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, nudge round to 4.30, it has the feel, even here, of just another Tuesday. At a college in the Morne Hercule area, Alex Georges is in a meeting with 30 other students and their professor.
M	At an orphanage outside the capital, Susan Westwood, a nurse from Stirling, is tending children. Over at Notre Dame Cathedral, the Archbishop of Port-au-Prince, Mgr Joseph Serge Miot, is in his office, working at his papers.
M	Jillian Thorp, an American aid worker, is at home in the capital, looking forward to her husband's return from a trip up country. In Haiti's parliament building, Senate President Kelly Bastien is at his post; the white presidential palace, looking like a Brighton Pavilion that's just come out of the wash, gleams across its watered lawns; US reporter Jonathan M Katz potters at home – after all, there's nothing much happening in Haiti at the moment.
3	And, at the 12-storey UN headquarters, the head of the mission, Hedi Annabi, and more than a hundred of his staff are coming to the end of the working day. They have authority here.
0	But not as much, it's about to turn out, as the geology on which Haiti sits. The Caribbean Plate progresses, on average, at the sedate pace of 2cm a year.
0	But, late this Tuesday afternoon, it takes a sudden lurch. In Guantanamo Bay, it feels as if a strong wind is blowing against the walls.
0	Elsewhere in Cuba, Eduardo Machin is tipped from his chair. He is fortunate. He is more than 400 miles from the seat of the tremor – a wholly inadequate word suggesting nothing more threatening than the quiver of a pensioner's hand.
0	In Port-au-Prince, no more than a 15-minute drive from the epicentre, things are different. At 4.53pm, a force 35 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb hits this poor, jerry-built city, giving it no more chance of surviving intact than the fragile toy of a bad-tempered child.
0	The quake lasts about 30 seconds, and, when it has finished, the landscape, and the lives of the two million people who inhabit it, are transformed – many by the crude expedient of being abruptly terminated. For those who survive, it must feel as if they've been mugged by God.
M	A few of the numberless dead had been sitting in the classroom with Alex Georges. The building shook, and then folded, killing 11.
M	He survived, and was later found in the car park of the Hotel Villa Creole, now being used as an emergency dressing station. He lay under a "tent" made from bloody sheets.
0	"I can't take it any more. My back hurts too much," he said, as he waited for treatment more than a day after the quake struck. At Susan Westwood's orphanage, "the wall started to shake and the floors were shaking.
0	Things were falling off of the shelves. We heard glass shattering. And really it seemed to go on for maybe 40 seconds.
0	It was terrifying ... babies were crying, the Haitian staff were terrified. They were hysterical."
0	At reporter Jonathan Katz's home "the house started to shake. Then it really started shaking. I walked out of my room and kneeled slowly to the undulating floor, laptop in hand, as windows, two years' worth of Haitian art and a picture of my grandfather smashed around me."
3	But, at the UN's HQ, not one of the hundred-plus people inside emerged to tell how it disintegrated. It would be two days before one of them, an Estonian security guard, was pulled from the ruins alive. And, in the ruins of the archdiocese office, missionaries eventually found the crushed body of Mgr Joseph Serge Miot, their archbishop.
0	For nearly a quarter of an hour after the first great shock subsided, the city was obscured in a grey pall of dust from the disintegration of buildings made from cheap cement. There was smoke, too, as fires, both great and small, broke out. And, from everywhere inside this miasma, came screams and howlings, and alarm systems stuck in a piercing groove.
0	But no sirens. No wail of emergency services; just the keening of a people left helpless. As visibility returned, so the scale of it all (a scale so great, no Richter could reflect its impact) started to become apparent.
2	The ornate National Palace crumbled into itself and now looked, with its white domes and fancy porticos broken and askew, like some ill-made wedding cake. The headquarters of the UN peacekeeping mission simply collapsed, as if it had been designed to do so. So did the Hotel Montana.
2	Gone, too, were the twin spires of the Notre Dame d'Haiti cathedral. The main prison cracked open, releasing some of its dazed inmates.
0	In Delmas Road, a major thoroughfare in the city, there were, as in many streets, more buildings fallen than standing. Homes and buildings that, minutes before, had stood on hillsides, were now so much scrap at the bottom of ravines.
0	And under this new city of rubble, crushed to death, broken-limbed and pinned down by masonry, or remarkably unscathed but still trapped in the sudden darkness by great shards of stone they could not move, were perhaps 100,000 people. Every so often, the geology that caused all this reminded the city it was still there, grinding away, five miles below.
1	Aftershocks came with such frequency that, by Thursday morning, the US Geological Survey had recorded 33. Thousands gathered in public squares, singing hymns and weeping; and they were not the only voices. Throughout the night, there were the echoing moans of the bereaved, and, softer but most plaintive of all, the cries from within the rubble of those still trapped.
M	From under a collapsed kindergarten in the Canape Vert area, a woman beseeched anyone who might be passing: "Please take me out, I am dying. I have two children with me."
M	And everywhere, people in shock. A woman sat outside a collapsed house.
M	Her baby – dead – was laid out on what used to be the roof. "Do you see my baby?", she asked passers-by.
4	As Wednesday dawned, in small pockets of Port-au-Prince, 3,000 police and international peacekeepers tried to clear roads and direct the desperate traffic, but the task was overwhelming. "We just don't know what to do," a Chilean peacekeeper said.
M	Some people fled, or tried to, balancing suitcases full of what they could rescue on their heads. An exodus began to the countryside, where the wood and cinderblock homes were too flimsy to have inflicted much damage when they collapsed.
6	Many of these shacks survived. All over the city, there were scenes resembling those in films depicting the scrabble for survival after a nuclear attack. In Petionville, people used sledgehammers and their bare hands to dig through a collapsed commercial centre, tossing aside mattresses and office supplies.
M	Nearby, about 200 survivors, including many children, huddled in a theatre car park and used sheets to rig makeshift tents to shield themselves from the sun. And when it had gone down again, in the frightening pitch black of Haiti's night, religious songs rose from groups of people huddled in open spaces for safety and solidarity. Yet there were, amid the ruins, stories of remarkable escapes.
4	A Canadian woman trapped under debris texted her country's Foreign Affairs Department in Ottawa for help. The message was relayed to diplomats in Haiti, and she was duly rescued.
M	And Jillian Thorp, an American aid worker, was pinned down for 10 hours in the wreckage of her mission house. But her husband Frank, up country at the time of the quake, drove 100 miles back to the capital, and dug for more than an hour to free her. Haitian Senate President Kelly Bastien was rescued from the collapsed parliament building and taken to a hospital in the Dominican Republic.
5	As Wednesday became Thursday, the bodies of the dead were still piled in the streets. Most were covered with sheets.
5	Passers-by would stop, lift the corner of the covering, and peer to see if a loved one was underneath. Outside one crumbled building, the bodies of five children and three adults lay heaped up, like refuse awaiting collection.
5	On many streets, alongside the dead lay the injured, waiting in agony for the help that may never come, their injuries fast turning infected. There were almost no ambulances, and few hospitals where the injured could be taken.
7	At least eight were ruined, others had large parts out of action, and many aid agency facilities were also unusable. The health centre of Médecins sans Frontières was damaged, and staff injured, but hundreds, lacking an alternative, still came. They scattered themselves around a courtyard, sleeping in tents, on top of rugs, on the floor and on plastic sheeting, waiting to be transferred to one of the two hospitals identified as safe enough to withstand the aftershocks.
7	More than 500 people needed immediate surgery. Whether they would get it was another matter.
7	Equipment was running low (they had no X-ray machines, surgeons or scalpels on Thursday), as was the petrol to transport patients, food and water. These were not the only problems.
4	Large numbers of its 800 medical workers in Haiti hadn't been seen since Tuesday afternoon. Cuba, which already had hundreds of doctors in Haiti, treated the injured in field hospitals, and the Hope for Haiti charity set up a mini-hospital outside the Villa Creole, where it tried to treat people for broken bones and internal bleeding.
5	The charity's country director, Mike Stewart, said on Wednesday night: "Ten who have come to us have died already. There will be more dead by morning.
7	We need to operate but we don't have the equipment." Neither did the US Red Cross, which said it was also running out of medical supplies.
M	For several days, makeshift was the only health service available. Pick-up trucks became ambulances, and doors and wheelbarrows became stretchers. But there is no substitute for clean water.
5	Veronique Taveau, spokeswoman for the UN children's fund, warned that, unless sufficient supplies of water came soon, survivors risked "all the diseases you can imagine" – dengue fever, malaria, measles and that great killer of disaster survivors – diarrhoea. On Thursday, help began to arrive.
4	Almost the first to land were the Chinese. More than 50 search-and-rescue specialists and medics barrelled out of a plane in orange jumpsuits, with dogs on leashes. They were all ready to go
4	but, such was the damage at and around the country's airport, they couldn't get very far. The British – 71 experienced rescuers – landed in the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, and travelled in by road through the early hours.
4	They were in Port-au-Prince before midday. More teams followed, from France, Iceland, Spain, Canada, Israel, Germany, Mexico and Venezuela.
7	They all had expertise. What few of them had was the heavy lifting equipment, and those that did, such as the British, had trouble getting it to where it was needed.
M	From the United States, a massive response was dispatched. The US has done more than its fair share to destabilise Haiti.
4	But recently, through former president Bill Clinton, its special envoy, and substantial financial assistance, it has begun to make amends. And, ordered by President Barack Obama, and steaming towards Haiti as fast as it could, was a flotilla of help: the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, three amphibious ships from the US Second Fleet, including the 844ft-long USS Bataan, which carried 2,000 Marines with helicopters, plus 8,000 troops.
4	The first contingent, from the 82nd Airborne Division, were on the ground by Friday, and the rest should arrive by tomorrow, but USS Comfort, a hospital ship with 12 operating rooms, will not arrive for a further five days. And there were, from around the world, those promises that do not always materialise in full: pledges of cash.
4	From the World Bank, $100m (£62m) and a pledge to "consider" a reconstruction trust fund; a similar sum from the US; from Britain, $10m; and many more from around the world: Australia ($9.3m), Norway ($5.3m), Japan and Canada ($5m), Spain ($4.3m), Italy ($1.4m), China and India ($1m). But, even on Friday, getting rescue and emergency medical help to those who needed it was proving, in the words of UN spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs, a "logistical nightmare". The capital's port was damaged beyond immediate use, and such was the wretched state of Port-au-Prince airport that 11 aid flights were turned away on Thursday, and it took six hours to unload one commercial plane.
7	By the end of the week, planes were packed on to tarmac so tightly that their wings overlapped. Nor was the airport connected to the city by a serviceable road.
7	And so parts of the relief operation that no lay person ever considers became vital, such as the four volunteers from the British charity MapAction who arrived on Thursday. They use on-site information, the latest mapping technology and satellite imagery to update existing maps and show where bridges or roads are no longer usable, where survivors have gathered, and the most effective way to get through.
3	UN peacekeepers and aid workers did try to fill in holes and build temporary bridges, but this was an organisation which was decapitated on Tuesday when the quake killed its two senior officials, and hundreds of those serving with them. At least 140 members of its staff are still buried, presumed dead, under the rubble of its headquarters.
7	Nor was there any functioning phone system, and the UN was working frantically with the independent aid agency Télécoms Sans Frontières to get some lines working again. There was still so much that was lacking, not least bodybags.
5	Tens of thousands were flown in on Friday, but there were increasing signs they would not be enough. The Red Cross, after several days', was estimating that between 40,000 and 50,000 had been killed on Tuesday.
M	How many have died since is anyone's guess. There are many like the woman in her twenties who, for more than two days, lay wounded and suffering on a patch of dirt by a road junction until, late Thursday, she had no more breath to give. Her family gently wiped the corner of her mouth, closed her eyes, said a prayer and covered her with a blanket.
M	Her father sat in some sort of vigil at her feet. He was asked her name.
5	All he could do was shake his head. By week's end, clearing corpses was a monstrous task.
5	Some 7,000 had been buried in a mass grave outside the city, but this was a fraction of the bodies littering the streets, filling the air with a stench so bad that few could go far without covering their noses. People took relatives to nearby hills for impromptu burials, others brought them to the mortuary at Hospital General, already filled to overflowing with more than 1,500 rapidly decomposing bodies, many of which had been lying in the sun.
5	No more than 20ft away the injured lay on mattresses. And, in the city centre, a photographer for Time magazine saw two roadblocks constructed from, among other materials that came to hand, dead bodies. Compared with these, the six dead, laid shoulder to shoulder under a dirty sheet on the steps of a pharmacy, have had a decent departure from this life.
6	By the weekend, many streets and parks had been turned into makeshift hospitals and refugee camps, most of them corralled with piles of salvaged goods. There were reports of people raiding ruined shops for food.
6	The accounts used the word "looting". "Surviving" might be more accurate. Not everyone who lived through that first terrible geological tantrum will survive.
M	This weekend perhaps one person should stand as their memorial. She is Haryssa Keem Clerge, and her home was in the Petionville area until, late on Tuesday afternoon, it collapsed into a ravine with her and her family inside.
M	On Wednesday, Haryssa's mother was pulled from the rubble, wounded but alive. Then, a little later, word went round the neighbourhood that Haryssa could be heard, crying and calling for rescue, from somewhere in the ruins.
M	People rushed to help, and, after they'd scrabbled for hours, they found her. She was in what had been the basement, and had been pinned down by part of the roof for two days.
M	Rescuers got close enough to give her water, but not food, and even as they told her to hang on she died. She was nine years old.
M	Finally, they were able to free her body, wrap her in a green towel, and place her in the discarded drawer of a broken desk. It will almost certainly be her coffin. Everywhere here this weekend there are Haryssas, and flies and the smell of decaying flesh.
0	This, truly, is the land of the dead and the pitiful undead. The magnitude-7.0 earthquake was one of the biggest to hit Haiti in the past 250 years.
0	Its destructive power was made worse because the point where the earth's crust began to rupture – its hypocentre – occurred at the relatively shallow depth of 13km (8.1 miles) beneath the surface. Shallow earthquakes usually have a bigger impact on buildings and roads.
0	Its force was exacerbated by the fact that its epicentre – the point on the ground surface where the earthquake was focused – was just 15km (9.3 miles) south-west of the capital Port-au-Prince. The seismic activity in this part of the world is dominated by the slow movement of two great tectonic plates that are grinding slowly past each other at a rate of about 2cm a year.
0	The vast North American Plate to the north is moving east while the Caribbean Plate to the south is moving west. Although the boundary line between these two tectonic plates lies beyond the north coast of Haiti, there are fault zones to the south that cut through the island from east to west.
0	It was the sudden jolt of one of these weak lines, called the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault Zone, that caused last week's devastation. Haiti has suffered a number of earthquakes in the past, most notably in the 18th century when substantial quakes were recorded in 1701, 1751 and 1770.
M	The 1751 earthquake was particularly bad, probably about 10 times bigger than the one last week. The lack of any substantial earthquakes in the region recently had lulled many people into believing that the risk had subsided.
0	But this simply meant that the underground stresses had been building up to a point where they would have to be suddenly released. The Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault accommodates a movement of about 7mm a year. It was inevitable that as the stresses built up, a sudden jolt of the fault would happen at some time.

0	It was immediately obvious that Tuesday's quake in Haiti would be an appalling natural disaster.
M	This was a large tremor centred on an impoverished country with little recent experience or preparedness for such an event. The buildings in the quake zones of major industrialised nations sit on damping systems that allow them to ride out tremors that not only shake them back and forth but also twist them in the same movement.
0	The simplest concrete structures in the capital of Port-au-Prince will have crumpled under the same strain. Seismometers recorded a preliminary magnitude of 7.0 at 1653 local time (2153 GMT). The epicentre's proximity to Port-au-Prince - 15km (10 miles) - and the focus (or depth) of just 8km (5 miles) will have ensured the destructive forces were at their most intense. "Closeness to the surface is a major factor contributing to the severity of ground shaking caused by an earthquake of any given magnitude," said Dr David Rothery, a planetary scientist with the Open University, UK. "Furthermore, shaking tends to be greatest directly above the source.
1	In this case the epicentre was only 15 km from the centre of the capital, Port au Prince, which therefore suffered very heavily." A series of strong aftershocks - more than 10 larger than Magnitude 5.0 - will have compounded the devastation.
M	In 1946, a M8.1 quake hit the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola, and produced a tsunami that killed almost 2,000 people. The last major earthquake in this part of Haiti was 150 years ago.
M	The greater geological setting is the northern boundary between the Caribbean and North America tectonic plates where vast slabs of the Earth's surface grind past each other in a horizontal motion. The Caribbean plate appears to shift eastward with respect to the North America plate by about 20mm per year. In the region where this quake occurred, this motion is accommodated across a number of strike-slip faults, the two main ones in Haiti being the Septentrional fault in the north and the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault in the south.

1	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti - A powerful aftershock sent Haitians screaming into the streets on Wednesday, collapsing buildings, cracking roads and adding to the trauma of a nation stunned by an apocalyptic quake eight days ago. The magnitude-5.9 jolt matched the strongest of the aftershocks that have followed the huge quake of Jan. 12 that devastated Haiti's capital.
1	The new temblor collapsed seven buildings in Petit-Goave, the seaside town closest to the epicenter, according to Mike Morton of the U.N. Disaster Assessment and Coordination agency, but there were no reports of people crushed or trapped, perhaps because the earlier quake frightened most people into sleeping outside. Wails of terror erupted in Port-au-Prince, where the aftershock briefly interrupted rescue efforts amid the broken concrete of collapsed buildings, and prompted doctors and patients to flee the University Hospital. Hundreds of thousands of Haitians remain homeless, hungry and in mourning _ most still waiting for the benefits of a nearly $1 billion global aid campaign.
M	At least one woman died of a heart attack in Port-au-Prince, according to Eddy Thomas, a private undertaker. "She had a heart condition, and the new quake finished her," he said while pushing her body along the street on a mobile stretcher.
1	At a golf course where 25,000 people live under sheets of plastic and old cloth, U.S. troops and quake victims alike raced for open ground as the quake began with a slow vibration and then intensified into side-to-side shaking that lasted about eight seconds. Some in Port-au-Prince said the far stronger Jan. 12 quake seemed to last for 30 seconds. "It kind of felt like standing on a board on top of a ball," said U.S. Army Staff Sgt.
M	Steven Payne. The 27-year-old from Jolo, West Virginia was preparing to hand out food to some of the 25,000 refugees living under plastic and old sheets on the grounds of a nine-hole golf course.
1	The U.S. Geological Survey said the aftershock was centered about 35 miles (60 kilometers) west-southwest of Port-au-Prince and 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) below the surface. It was a little further from the capital than last week's magnitude-7.0 quake, which the killed an estimated 200,000 people, left 250,000 injured and made 1.5 million homeless, according to the European Union.
M	The strong aftershock prompted Anold Fleurigene, 28, to grab his wife and three children and head to the city bus station. His house was destroyed in the first quake and his sister and brother killed.
1	"I've seen the situation here, and I want to get out," he said. The aftershock also ripped 8-inch (20-centimeter) cracks in a road west of the capital near Leogane, where U.S. Marines were setting up a post to aid quake victims who are sleeping in streets, culverts and driveways, often under tree branches draped with sheets to guard against the sun.
7	The new shake, combined with a light rain on Tuesday, has complicated rescue efforts, said Dr. Yi Ting Tsai, part of a Taiwanese crew digging for survivors near the ruined cathedra. "The problem is the rain and the new quake this morning has made the debris more compact," he said.
1	Wednesday's temblor matched the strongest of 49 aftershocks of magnitude-4.5 or greater that have followed the Jan. 12 quake. USGS geophysicist Bruce Pressgrave said nobody knows if a still-stronger aftershock is possible.
1	"Aftershocks sometimes die out very quickly," he said. "In other cases they can go on for weeks, or if we're really unlucky it could go on for months" as the earth adjusts to the new stresses caused by the initial quake.
4	More aid was arriving on Wednesday, notably the U.S. Navy's floating hospital, USNS Comfort, which was already treating two severely injured quake victims when it dropped anchor in view of Port-au-Prince. She ship carries about 550 medical staff and about 60 civilian mariners.
M	Search-and-rescue teams have emerged from the city's ruins with some improbable success stories _ including the rescue of 69-year-old ardent Roman Catholic who said she prayed constantly during her week under the rubble. Ena Zizi had been at a church meeting at the residence of Haiti's Roman Catholic archbishop when the Jan. 12 quake struck, trapping her in debris. On Tuesday, she was rescued by a Mexican disaster team.
M	Zizi said after the quake, she spoke back and forth with a vicar who also was trapped. But he fell silent after a few days, and she spent the rest of the time praying and waiting. Doctors who examined Zizi on Tuesday said she was dehydrated and had a dislocated hip and a broken leg.
M	Elsewhere in the capital, two women were pulled from a destroyed university building. And near midnight Tuesday, a smiling and singing 26-year-old Lozama Hotteline was carried to safety from a collapsed store in the Petionville neighborhood by the French aid group Rescuers Without Borders.
7	Dr. Jon Kim Andrus, deputy director for the Pan American Health Organization, said that international aid teams have saved 121 people from the rubble, "and countless more have been rescued by Haitians working with no equipment at all," he said. The World Food Program said more than 250,000 ready-to-eat food rations had been distributed in Haiti by Tuesday, reaching only a fraction of the 3 million people thought to be in desperate need. The WFP said it needs to deliver 100 million ready-to-eat rations in the next 30 days, but it only had 16 million meals in the pipeline.
7	U.S. troops landed in Seahawk helicopters Tuesday on the manicured lawn of the ruined National Palace on Tuesday, but the colossal efforts to help Haiti were proving inadequate because of the scale of the disaster. Expectations exceeded what money, will and military might have been able to achieve. Governments have pledged nearly $1 billion in aid, and thousands of tons of food and medical supplies have been shipped.
7	But much remains trapped in warehouses, or diverted to the neighboring Dominican Republic. Port-au-Prince's nonfunctioning seaport and many impassable roads complicate efforts to get aid to the people.
4	Aid is still being turned back from the single-runway airport, where the U.S. military has been criticized by some of poorly prioritizing flights. The U.S. Air Force said it had raised the facility's daily capacity from 30 flights before the quake to 180. About 2,200 U.S. Marines have established a beachhead west of Port-au-Prince, joining 9,000 Army soldiers already on the ground.
4	Lt. Cmdr. Walter Matthews, a U.S. military spokesman, said helicopters were ferrying aid from the airport into Port-au-Prince and the nearby town of Jacmel as fast as they could. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the military will send a port-clearing ship with cranes aboard to Port-au-Prince to remove debris that is preventing many larger aid ships from docking.

M	The devastating January 12 earthquake in Haiti also set off a swarm of unusual tsunamis, which killed three and destroyed several homes, experts said today. Though surveying damage and rescuing survivors was of utmost priority for several weeks, scientists are now starting to examine some of the side effects of the temblor, such as the tsunamis.
0	The waves, which averaged about ten feet (three meters) high, slammed shores along the Bay of Port-au-Prince and the southern coast of the island of Hispaniola (see map), which is shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic. At least one wave hit the shore as far as 62 miles (100 kilometers) away from the earthquake's epicenter, near Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
0	Tsunamis are rare though not unheard of in the Caribbean—a 1946 wave in the Dominican Republic killed nearly 2,000 people, said Hermann Fritz, a civil and coastal engineer who worked with a team from Haiti's Quisqueya University to study the tsunamis. Yet the Haiti tsunami swarm was unusual, since earthquakes usually need to be bigger than the recent magnitude 7.0 quake to spawn the killer waves, said Fritz, whose team will present its findings Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union's Ocean Sciences Meeting in Portland, Oregon. Fritz and colleagues visited Haiti after the recent earthquake to look for physical evidence of the tsunamis, which had been detected by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Caribbean buoys.
8	Satellite images gave the team possible locations of wave impacts. At these sites, the researchers found sand deposits, debris, tree scars, and other signs that tsunamis had hit throughout the region. The team also discovered that the tsunami swarm had included two types of waves.
8	Tectonic tsunamis are caused by the movement of plates on the seafloor. Landslide-generated tsunamis occur when unstable land collapses into the water following an earthquake. Tectonic tsunamis usually take minutes to hours to arrive on shore, giving people trained in spotting the danger time to escape. Landslide tsunamis are more localized and are usually much smaller.
8	In Haiti, a man and two boys were killed by a landslide wave at Grand Goave, a town along the Bay of Port-au-Prince, as they watched from the shore, the team's survey found. Several coastal homes were also swept out into the water.
M	The victims were among many earthquake survivors who had gathered on Haitian beaches to watch the incoming waves as "kind of a spectacle" instead of fleeing, Fritz said. For people familiar with tsunamis, feeling the earth shake is the obvious sign to run from the shore, he said. Not surprisingly, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere lacks basic tsunami preparedness, such as warning signs on beaches, Fritz added. But as Haiti picks up the pieces following the record January 12 earthquake, educating the public about tsunami waves is crucial: With more than 200 years since the last "big one" in Haiti, bigger earthquakes—and giant tsunamis—may be possible.

4	An AFP correspondent in the nearby town of Petionville said one three-story building had been toppled, and a tractor was already at the scene trying to dig out victims as people fled onto the streets in panic.

4	Red Cross worker In the worst hit areas, crisis teams have been scrambled from among Haitian professionals and local government chiefs, determined to take a lead. Their job is to determine the need for the weeks and months ahead.
0	"Schools will be a priority," says Leogane deputy mayor Vincent Saint Juste. "We also want to rebuild the churches and health clinics. This is a city where 90% of the buildings were destroyed and the remaining ones are unsafe.
7	So we have to start from scratch. It's a city that has to be totally rebuilt."
4	The Red Cross is beginning to send out assessment teams to determine what food, shelter and medicine Haitians will need. "Don't be fooled by the fact that this looks like business as usual," said one Red Cross Worker, who has travelled the world responding to natural disasters. People here have been incredibly resilient, but although you see them out trading on the streets, clinging on to some sense of normality, Haiti remains a country deeply shaken by the events of the past two weeks.

M	PORT-AU-PRINCE --
M	No one can find the administration director. The facilities chief hasn't checked in.
5	City Hall is now a skeletal hulk of concrete and stucco, sagging grotesquely to the left. In that ruined building are lists that Edouard Laurole, Port-au-Prince's human resources director, wants badly to unearth. Lists of employees, phone numbers, addresses and passwords, all lost since last week's earthquake.
7	"This is awful," Laurole says heavily, pressing a palm against his brow. In the wretched chaos of Port-au-Prince, Laurole and a few others are trying vainly to reconstitute a scattered and shattered city government responsible for nearly a million people, slightly fewer than half of the residents of the metropolitan area.
4	Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to live in the streets and are desperate for assistance. But before the city can take care of its people, the city government has to fix itself.
7	Only a fraction of city employees have working cellphones. The city has no municipal gasoline reserve, so its crews wait in long lines for gas -- like everyone else. And it is down to only a handful of functioning vehicles.
7	City officials need many things, but right now what they really need is a place to hold a planning meeting. For days, they have conducted the affairs of Haiti's capital from a folding table on the stone-paved driveway of a borrowed mansion in Canape Vert, a once-lush Port-au-Prince neighborhood now overrun with cinder-block shacks. The stench of rotting bodies outside the mansion's walls mixes with the perfume of the flowering trees inside. At the mansion, the officials find that their welcome is wearing thin.
M	"At this point, I'm the boss," Laurole says, explaining that he had been unable to reach the mayor. "Normally this would not be my responsibility. But someone has to take charge." He says he draws inspiration from Rudolph W. Giuliani's efforts as mayor of New York in the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

4	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Half of Haiti's schools and its three main universities were destroyed or badly damaged in the earthquake, but classes must resume even in tents to help children overcome trauma, the education minister said. "What we have seen is the total collapse of the Haitian education system," Joel Jean-Pierre told Reuters at the government's temporary headquarters in a police station.
0	About half the nation's 15,000 primary schools and 1,500 secondary schools were hit in the quake, he said, creating an enormous challenge for the Western hemisphere's poorest nation. The three main universities in Port-au-Prince were also "almost totally destroyed," Jean-Pierre said.
M	Already desperately short of resources and struggling with poor infrastructure, Haiti now has to cope with its pulverisation from one of the world's worst earthquakes. The government says most of Port-au-Prince will have to be rebuilt, and between 100,000 and 200,000 people died in Tuesday's 7.0 magnitude earthquake.
0	"At the time of the disaster, just before 5 p.m., there were many schools still working because this was the second session of the day. And the universities were all still working.
4	So many, many people died inside," the minister said. Classes could be a focus for post-traumatic stress help and for feeding, the minister said.
X	Jean-Pierre said his own ministry collapsed, with 25 rescued alive so far from 100 people inside at the time. Like cabinet colleagues, his family suffered losses. "My brother has just called to say he is collecting the bodies of his wife and children," he said.
4	Though preoccupied with the immediate aid operation, the United Nations has already said how important reviving the education system is for the country's long-term prospects. "The destruction of the university in Port-au-Prince and of numerous secondary and primary schools in Tuesday's earthquake, and the human loss of teachers and students, is a catastrophic set-back for a country already hit by other disasters," the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization said in a statement.
4	UNESCO director-general Irina Bokova said the global body would rally support for temporary facilities and rebuilding. "I also urge academia to show solidarity. Universities in the region and beyond should make every effort to take in Haitian students," she said in a statement.

6	PORT-AU-PRINCE -
0	The January 12 earthquake in Haiti didn't stop at taking lives and crippling people. It also wreaked havoc on the very foundations of the country's institutions, such as government ministries, hospitals and schools.
4	It has halted, for the time being, the training of much-needed midwives. Quettely Chevalier, a teacher at Haiti's only midwifery school, was giving a lecture on obstetric care at the nearby Lumiere University when the earthquake hit. As the rumbling of the quake started, many students panicked and ran for the exit.
2	Chevalier too, made for the door and escaped unharmed. The neighbouring nursing school-one of three official nursing schools in the country-was reduced to rubble. When the dust settled, lockers containing hospital gowns peeked through gaping holes in the structure, and the school's bus was crushed by falling bricks as the walls gave in. The midwifery school was left standing, but may have structural damage too serious for future use.
5	At a time when many Haitian health workers have either been killed or are seriously injured and in need of medical care, the recruitment of a new generation of nurses and midwives is all the more urgent. The midwifery school had 78 students and turned out about 35 midwives each year-an important and much-needed contribution towards reducing the country's maternal mortality rate. At 670 deaths per 100,000 live births, it is the highest in the Western hemisphere and one of the highest in the world.
X	Classes at the midwifery school ended at four o'clock on the day of the earthquake, less than an hour before the disaster struck. By then, students and teachers had scattered, and no one knows where they all are or how they fared.
X	Many of the students had internships at hospitals, and could have lost their lives or been injured there or at the university, where some of them studied. "We know the director of the school is alive, but we have not been able to communicate with her," said Chevalier.
4	All levels of the health and women's affairs sectors have been seriously affected. "We lost ninety per cent of our partners in the Ministry of Women's Affairs when its building collapsed," said Tania Patriota, UNFPA Representative for Haiti.
7	It is early yet to start reconstruction efforts. Earthquake victims are still receiving emergency care in and around hospitals and makeshift clinics, rubble is blocking streets and homeless people are sleeping on streets, sidewalks and in parks.
M	The smell of decaying bodies is lingering in the air. However, before too long, Haiti will have to start its long road towards recovery. "If there is work, I will be there right away," said Chevalier.

2	At Port-au-Prince’s main art museum, it looked as if a cruel giant had taken bites out of the walls and ceiling of the cavernous exhibition hall. Large wooden panels where paintings once hung had toppled.
5	A bronze bust of DeWitt Peters, a California water colorist widely credited with bringing international attention to Haitian art in the 1940s, lay on the ground. Joseph Gaspard, a member of the board of directors of the College Saint Pierre museum, was inspecting the site Saturday for the first time since the Jan. 12 earthquake, crunching broken glass as he walked through the debris. He struggled not to cry.
M	Since the quake, gallery owners have been trying to pull together a list of artists killed, injured or missing. They’d accounted for about half of those they represented.
M	Untold is the toll in artworks, with their wild colors and real-life portrayals; their lions, tigers and bears, though those animals don’t exist in Haiti; their echoes of voodoo traditions and the nation’s African roots. “It is difficult to talk about saving art when we must save lives,” said painter Maritou Chenet, whose oldest friends were killed in the disaster. But art is such an integral part of Haitian life that the works must be protected, she said, even as the buildings housing them are demolished.
6	Days ago, she watched as employees of the Centre d’Art used a long stick and fished to safety the Jasmin Joseph painting that dangled from the building’s ruined rafters. Then Chenet, 74, carefully removed the canvas from its frame, rolled the prized piece and hid it away for safekeeping. “It was a big temptation,” Chenet, whose family has always been part of the Haitian art world, said of the valuable artworks that lay exposed in the Centre d’Art after the quake.
M	For more than half a century, the center symbolized the heart of Haiti’s world-famous art. It was here that artists in the 1940s were nurtured and eventually commercialized as perhaps the most successful ever Haitian export. Haitian oils and watercolors grace public and private collections the world over.
2	The facade of the building was sheared off in the magnitude 7.0 earthquake. Above mounds of fallen brick and fractured timber, paintings still hang precariously, the vivid blues and greens of iconic Haitian landscapes peeking through damaged walls.
4	Axelle Liautaud, an avid collector and renowned patron of the arts, is busily traveling from one damaged site to another. She personally salvaged several paintings at the College Saint Pierre, surveyed the priceless murals in the devastated Trinity Episcopal Church and is trying to help Chenet find tarps to protect what’s left of the Centre d’Art. Liautaud is working with UNESCO, which assigned special envoy Bernard Hadjadj to the task of assessing damage and finding protection.
2	The Nader Art Gallery, considered the largest single collection of Haitian primitive art, a mecca for visitors who cherished its paintings and metal sculptures, collapsed. The Nader family escaped, but a maid was killed. The site looks like an archaeological dig, a mound of disaster covered in shards of ceramics and broken picture frames.
2	At the Monnin Gallery, a prominent center in the affluent suburb of Petionville, shellshocked artists streamed in Saturday to reconnect with patrons and be reminded that life would go on. In the gallery, paintings on the wall were askew, the force of the quake having turned them counterclockwise as they hung. A collection of Bizango statues, representing the enforcers of the high priests of voodoo and made with real human skulls, had fallen to the ground.
M	Mireille Delice is a well-known creator of the “flags,” or banners, a form of Haitian art that is a piece of cloth, usually satin, decorated with beads or sequins. In the quake she lost her sister, her house and her box of sequins. “We have to keep on,” she said, seated at the gallery with other artists.
M	Gabriel Coutard, a much sought-after painter, wandered in, in the same clothes he has been wearing since the quake. He seemed, still, stunned, unable to finish sentences.
M	Inevitably, art has caught up to reality. Frantz Zephirin, whose work graces the cover of this week’s New Yorker, has already incorporated the earthquake in his art. He ambled into the Monnin Gallery, his newest creation tucked under his arm. It is a swirl of blue and green, with lots of eyeballs peering from the canvas, and a collection of outstretched hands reaching for help.

4	WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The World Bank said on Tuesday it was ready to send a team to Haiti to assess the extent of damage caused by the earthquake and begin working on plans for rebuilding the country. The bank said it was also ready to mobilize aid to Haiti but did not elaborate on how much it could make available. It said its offices in a suburb of the capital Port-au-Prince were destroyed by the quake and most bank employees were accounted for.

4	Citigroup Inc said on Sunday it had resumed operations in Haiti, but has relocated operations after a massive earthquake on January 12 damaged its main building and killed five employees. Citi, which has been in Haiti since 1971, said it will serve corporate customers out of the ScotiaBank Building in Petion-Ville. The company said on Jan 13 that its three-story main building in Port-au-Prince had suffered extensive damage. It was the most powerful earthquake to affect Haiti in more than a century.

M	Un barrage formé par l'affaissement d'un pan de montagne lors du tremblement de terre pourrait céder pendant la saison des pluies et causer beaucoup de dégâts à Grand-Goâve. Haïti croyait avoir tout vu en matière de catastrophes, mais voici qu'une nouvelle menace plane sur la commune de Grand-Goâve, à 50 km de la capitale: un barrage formé dans les montagnes par le tremblement de terre pourrait emporter davantage de vies et d'habitations s'il venait à céder.
X	Yves Gattereau saute d'un rocher et pique une tête dans l'eau turquoise qui s'étend devant lui. Le paysage est montagneux et sauvage. Le silence est total.
8	Si la scène semble idyllique, elle est loin de l'être. Le lac dans lequel M. Gattereau vient de plonger ne devrait pas exister. Il s'est formé quand un pan de montagne s'est affaissé lors du tremblement de terre, bloquant le cours de la rivière Grand-Goâve.
4	Yves Gattereau est un ingénieur forestier québécois installé en Haïti depuis 22 ans. Celui qui dirige une équipe d'intervention sur les bassins versants pour Oxfam-Québec est inquiet.
8	Il montre le mur de roc contre lequel l'eau s'accumule depuis un mois. La situation ne semble pas critique pour l'instant. Le barrage est énorme et il reste plusieurs dizaines de mètres avant que l'eau ne passe par-dessus. Le hic, c'est qu'il n'a pratiquement pas plu depuis le tremblement de terre du 12 janvier.
8	Quand la saison des pluies se déclenchera, d'ici quelques semaines tout au plus, l'eau s'accumulera ici très rapidement. Que se passera-t-il si le barrage cède?
8	M. Gattereau admet qu'il ne peut le dire avec certitude. Mais il rappelle la topographie du terrain pour nous faire comprendre les risques.
2	Dire que celle-ci n'est pas prête pour une nouvelle catastrophe est un euphémisme. Davantage une commune dispersée qu'une ville, Grand-Goâve compte quelque 110 000 habitants et a été détruite à 90% par le tremblement de terre. Ici, la population vit dans des abris faits de bouts de bois sur lesquels on a tendu des draps et des morceaux de carton. Les tentes qu'on voit à Port-au-Prince ne sont pas arrivées ici; même les bâches de plastique sont rarissimes. C'est en examinant des images satellites du logiciel Google Earth qu'Yves Gattereau a découvert le barrage.
4	Sa formation lui a permis de détecter le problème, mais il n'a pas l'expertise pour le régler. Depuis, il ne sait pas quoi faire. «Ce n'est pas encore urgent. Je ne voulais pas alerter la population et créer une panique supplémentaire», dit-il.
4	Il a finalement décidé de joindre La Presse pour qu'elle diffuse l'information. L'armée américaine a aussi eu vent de la situation. Vendredi dernier, elle a envoyé une équipe sur place.
8	«On pourrait probablement faire sauter le barrage, mais nous n'avons aucune idée des conséquences que cela aurait», a dit à La Presse Jason Mangone, premier lieutenant de la marine américaine. Il a fait une demande pour qu'un expert en dynamique des fluides vienne sur les lieux. Il souligne que l'accès difficile au barrage compliquera les choses.
4	L'endroit se gagne en effet au prix d'une éprouvante expédition qui débute par une randonnée de moto dans l'immense lit quasi asséché de la rivière. Les motos restent régulièrement prises dans le sable, les rochers ou l'eau. Il faut ensuite marcher dans la rivière, parfois avec de l'eau jusqu'à la taille, et contourner certaines zones impraticables en grimpant les parois. En chemin, l'équipe d'Yves Gattereau qu'a accompagnée La Presse a croisé deux militaires de la marine américaine qui rebroussaient chemin.
4	«Je suis trop vieux pour ce genre de choses. On va essayer d'envoyer un hélicoptère», a lancé l'un des deux hommes, Steve Krutke.

6	Sixteen hours after he was thrown onto a Port-au-Prince rubbish dump and set alight, the body of the lynched thief was still smouldering – a macabre glimpse of the sporadic violence that is flaring up in this desperate city.
6	With water, food and shelter in short supply for hundreds of thousands of earthquake survivors, localised flashpoints of looting and vigilante action to punish the perpetrators have arisen across the city. Haitian police were also reported to have shot dead at least one looter.
6	Incongruously, the thief's last resting place lay between two institutions of peace and culture. On one side of the street in which he lay was a church, on the other an art gallery, the Musart Beau Decor. The body had been burned to a cinder but you could see the remnants of a tyre that had been lain on or around him as part of the living funeral pyre of rubbish that had been created for him by the lynch mob.
6	The thief — whose identity will probably never be known other than the description offered by locals of "le voleur" — made the fatal error of trying to steal fruit juice from a nearby street vendor in Petionville, a neighbourhood of Port-au-Prince where there is a relatively active police presence. By some accounts, the man pulled out a gun and shot the vendor in the head as he was making the robbery.
6	Police were close at hand — their headquarters are just a few blocks away — and the thief was apprehended. What happened next is unclear.
6	But the end result is certain: he was frogmarched by about 12 men, beaten, thrown on the street, covered with a pyre of rubbish, and burned. Antoine Miguel, a resident who was among a group assembled around the smouldering corpse, said that it was suspected the thief was one of 3,000 inmates who broke out of the National Penitentiary in the city after the earthquake unexpectedly granted them freedom. The quake released a few prisoners, who in turn overpowered the guards and opened all the cells, pouring on to the streets several of the most dangerous gang leaders who had previously terrorised parts of the city.
6	Reuters reporters gained access to the inside of the prison where they found that on their way out the inmates had burned most of the prison records, making the job of tracking them down and bringing them back to jail all the more difficult. The prison breakout has spread fear, particularly in Cite Soleil, a poor neighbourhood with a notorious history of gang violence that had begun to become more peaceful under the interventions of Haitian president Rene Prevail.
6	Now Cite Soleil is braced for a return of the gangs. "They got out of prison and now they're going around trying to rob people," said Cite Soleil resident Elgin St Louis, 34, told Reuters.
M	"Last night they spent the whole night shooting," she added. "We dread their return," said another. So far, warnings that Port-au-Prince would descend into anarchy have not materialised.
6	Lawlessness has been localised and confined largely to the night. But the few incidents have been brutal. In the Delmar neighbourhood, two suspected looters were tied together and beaten before being dragged through the streets.

M	JUAN GONZALEZ:
M	Amy Goodman is in Haiti, and we’ll be joining her in a few minutes. But first, we turn to a voice from one hospital in Port-au-Prince that was badly destroyed by last week’s earthquake. The General Hospital is three blocks from the crumbling National Palace. Former President Bill Clinton visited the hospital Monday, as hundreds of people with broken limbs and multiple fractures were waiting for medical supplies to arrive.
M	Democracy Now! reached Dr. Evan Lyon at the General Hospital Monday evening.
M	He is a doctor with Partners in Health. DR. EVAN LYON:
2	We’ve been working around the clock since our team from Partners in Health came to meet up with our Haitian colleagues, who are still here and still leading and still helping us recover to try to get this hospital back up and running. The infrastructure is really, you know, completely destroyed. There is a nursing school on this campus that collapsed completely, killing really, as far as we know now, the entire class of second-year nursing students.
7	The medical school right behind me is — will not ever be usable again. But the main problem is that this General Hospital, the main general public hospital for the city of Port-au-Prince, is still barely operational.
4	We have a thousand patients scattered throughout the campus, mostly sleeping under the stars or sleeping in tents, a thousand patients who have been triaged, assessed. They’re getting primary care. They’re getting good medical care from Haitian staff and from volunteer international relief staff.
4	But we are just scratching the surface of the operative needs of the orthopedic and other operative needs. Again, 1,000 people in need of operations, and we’re just barely starting to scratch the surface.
M	Two days ago, we began operating. We had four operating rooms up as quick as possible and have been using them ever since.
7	We don’t have full proper anesthesia. We’re missing many of the materials we need.
M	But that has been working. As of last night, we have some electricity on the campus, and we’ll be able to start operating twenty-four hours a day through this night and on through tomorrow.
6	I think, you know, the singing and the [inaudible], I know, is clear to many, certainly anyone who has followed Haiti and cared about this special country. One thing that I think is really important for people to understand is that misinformation and rumors and, I think at the bottom of the issue, racism has slowed the recovery efforts of this hospital.
6	Security issues over the last forty-eight hours have been our — quote “security issues” over the last forty-eight hours have been our leading concern. And there are no security issues.
X	I’ve been with my Haitian colleagues. I’m staying at a friend’s house in Port-au-Prince.
X	We’re working for the Ministry of Public Health for the direction of this hospital as volunteers. But I’m living and moving with friends. We’ve been circulating throughout the city until 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning every night, evacuating patients, moving materials.
6	There’s no UN guards. There’s no US military presence. There’s no Haitian police presence.
X	And there’s also no violence. There is no insecurity.

4	Such concerns evoke little sympathy from the people waiting for aid. "I understand these people are worried about the risks of bringing aid to us, you cannot save us if you cannot save yourself," said the Rev Paul Frantz Cole as he finished taking morning service at his Anglican church in the Carrefour district.

M	Remenión, jamaquión, temblor, sismo, juidero, panico, corre corre.
0	Ayer martes 12 de Enero cinco minutos antes de las seis, la isla volvió a recordarnos que se mueve, que no es un pedazo de tierra estático, que sus placas no son como las de los carros y que el suelo no pide permisos para sus sacudidas instantáneas.
M	Shakes, a quake, tremors, earthquake, panic, call it what you wish. Yesterday, on Tuesday, January 12, at 5 minutes to 6 pm, the island once again reminded us that it moves, that it is not a piece of static earth, that its plates are not like those of cars and that the ground does not ask for permission for instantaneous shakes.
0	Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince located 10 miles east of the earthquake's epicenter, was left devastated and incommunicado. Buildings had collapsed, and left countless thousands injured or dead, as there are no official numbers. Without electricity, water, or communication, several hours passed before the entire world could witness the damage caused by the earthquake.
2	Many of these photographs and testimonies were distributed via social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. The scene was grim, and to make matters worse, the aftershocks did not let up.
4	In the Dominican Republic, as a result of the earthquake, a tsunami alert was placed in effect, and the Emergency Operations Commission (COE) closed the commercial plazas in the capital Santo Domingo and took precautions along the coastal zones and on the Haitian border. In the early morning hours of the next day, Dominican President Leonel Fernández called an emergency meeting to put together a aid commission for Haiti, which included aid for health, water, electricity, infrastructure, and the assistance of the military. Desde tempranas horas de hoy, las autoridades, empresariado y militares dominicanos unen sus fuerzas para movilizar ayuda humanitaria ante el temblor de Haití.
4	From the early morning hours today [Wednesday, January 13] the authorities, businesses, and the Dominican military joined forces to mobilize humanitarian help for the Haiti earthquake. The Dominican team help send food and bottled water, and sent heavy machinery to help remove the rubble.
4	The hospitals in the province of Barahona were made available, as well as the airport to receive aid that would be distributed to Haiti. Personnel from the COE attended to more than 2,000 injured and the Dominican Institute of Telecommunications (Indotel) helped to restore telephony services. The Dominican Red Cross and the International Red Cross have been coordinating health relief services.
4	The Dominican Republic has also been a landing point for foreign correspondents who have come to cover the tragedy. In addition to the efforts of the government, many Dominicans have joined the cause with collection centers, while others have offered private plnes and other materials destine for Haiti. Duarte 101
M	[es] writes a short summary of the help needed and collection points across the Dominican Republic. El pueblo dominicano se ha volcado para ayudar a Haití. Lo que ha ocurrido en Haití no tiene precedente.
M	Es demasiado dolor. Demasiado sufrimiento.
M	Aquí se paran las diferencias absurdas y se impone la solidaridad pura y simple. Abierta y decidida. Es este el justo momento
M	para ayudar a un pueblo hermano. Démosle la mano y el alma a un pueblo que no merece tanto sufrimiento.
M	The Dominican people have bent over backwards to help Haiti. What happened in Haiti has no precedent.
M	There is too much pain. Too much suffering. The absurd differences stop here and solidarity is imposed, pure and simple, openly and decidedly.
M	This is the right moment to help our brother nation. Let's give our hand and our soul to a people that do not deserve so much suffering.

4	El Gobierno de República Dominicana anunció este miércoles que en las próximas horas saldrá un avión a Haití con personal especializado que colaborará con el rescate de las víctimas atrapadas en los escombros que dejó el terremoto de 7,3 grados en la escala de Ritcher que golpeó este martes a esa nación caribeña.
4	El responsable de prensa del palacio presidencial, Rafael Núñez, informó a la prensa de que enviarán a Puerto Príncipe médicos, medicinas, alimentos, personal de rescate y perros amaestrados, y anunció que dispondrán de más ayuda humanitaria una vez que se tenga un balance de los daños ocasionados por el terremoto. El Ministerio de Salud Pública, por su parte, enviará ocho Clínicas Móviles con una flota de 36 médicos con especialidades en Ortopedia, Traumatología, Anestesiólogos, y Cirujanos, una gran cantidad de Vacunas y Medicamentos.
4	El Gobierno de Fernández también ha hecho un llamamiento a la comunidad internacional para que acuda en ayuda de Haití donde se estima que miles de personas han quedado atrapadas bajo los escombros de los edificios y casas que se derrumbaron tras el fuerte seísmo. "Haití, lamentablemente no está en condiciones de hacer frente a ese tipo de eventualidades, por lo que nosotros como Gobierno hacemos un llamado a la comunidad internacional para que envíe brigadas de socorro para este tipo de eventos", expresó Núñez.
4	Los primeros aviones de la Fuerza Aérea Dominicana saldrán en horas de la mañana (tarde en España) a Puerto Príncipe, según las instrucciones dadas por Fernández al Ejército dominicano. Las autoridades dominicanas informaron además del envío de 39 camiones de alimentos enlatados, 10 cocinas móviles y 110 cocineros que llegaron este miércoles en la madrugada al país vecino para producir 100.000 raciones diarias de comida.
X	El Instituto Dominicano de Telecomunicaciones anunció además el envío de brigadas de técnicos especializados de la Empresa Viva para ayudar en el restablecimiento de las comunicaciones en Haití. El Centro de Operaciones de Emergencias (COE) levantó este miércoles la alerta roja decretada en 17 provincias de República Dominica al determinar que "las condiciones para que se genere un Tsunami en el país se han reducido significativamente".
M	República Dominicana decretó este martes la alerta máxima en varias provincias ante la posibilidad de que se produjera un tsunami por el terremoto que tuvo lugar en Haití y que afectó, no sólo territorio dominicano, sino también parte del este de Cuba. Las provincias en las que se había decretado la alerta máxima son La Altagracia, La Romana, San Pedro de Macorís, Distrito Nacional, San Cristóbal, Azua, Barahona, Santo Domingo, Peravia, Pedernales, Montecristi, Puerto Plata, Maria Trinidad Sánchez, Samaná, Hato Mayor, El Seibo y Espaillat (Gaspar Hernández y Cabarete).

6	רבים מהם מבקשים להגיע לאזור הכפרי, שנפגע פחות מרעש האדמה, בחיפוש אחר מקלט אצל חברים וקרובי משפחה, כשמיטלטליהן בידיהם. אחרים העמיסו את כלי הרכב שלהם וברחו מהעיר, ממתינים במשך שעות בתחנות הדלק לתדלק את רכביהם.

4	There has recently been a flurry of activity in the Open Street Map community to improve maps of Haiti to assist humanitarian aid organisations responding to the recent earthquake.
0	In particular mappers and developers are scouring satellite images to identify collapsed and damaged buildings/bridges, spontaneous refugee camps, landslides, blocked roads and other damaged infrastructure – to help NGOs and international organisations respond more effectively to the crisis. On January 12 2010, a 7.0 earthquake struck Port-au-Prince.
4	The OpenStreetMap community can help the response by tracing Yahoo imagery and other data sources, and collecting existing data sets below. If you have connections with expat Haitian communities, consider getting in touch to work with them to enter place names, etc.
4	On Wednesday Mikel Maron wrote to the OSM talk list asking for help. Yesterday several companies authorised the OSM community to use their images. Recently generated data from Open Street Map has been used in maps by ITHACA (Information Technology for Humanitarian Assistance, Cooperation and Action) and the World Food Programme.
4	Yesterday evening Mikel Maron reported there had been over 400 edits since the earthquake. At the time of writing it looks like this has now more than doubled to over 800 edits since 12th January.

M	In Miami's "Little Haiti" neighborhood, waves of shock and grief continue to roll over community members.
M	As the extent of devastation in their homeland becomes clear, people are trying to figure out how to get information from the earthquake zone and cope with their losses. A communications blackout continued Thursday and many in the community of 110,000 Haitian-Americans remained frantic about the fate of friends and relatives.
7	Thursday morning, shopkeeper Francesca Jean clutched a cell phone held together with duct tape. She had pressed "redial" too many times.
7	"Since yesterday I've been trying to get in contact with Haiti and I'm trying to call my mom and my brother to see if they're OK, but I don't have no signal or nothing," Jean says. The lack of communication with Haiti has become a tremendous logistical issue.
4	Donations are coming in: 50,000 portable housing units from one source, generators from another, supplies of bottled water from a third. But Frantzy DeRose, director of the local Haitian-American alliance, says the need cannot be accurately measured.
M	Hundreds gathered Wednesday night for a prayer service at Notre Dame d'Haiti Catholic Church in Miami. At the beginning of a Creole song of mourning, attendees were restrained. But emotions gradually erupted and by the end of the hymn people were wailing, some of them kneeling in tears with their hands in the air, or even rolling on the floor.
M	Father Reginald Jean-Mary reminded them that Haiti has historically suffered misfortune followed by worldwide apathy. But he said Haitians are the children of God as much as anyone, and they deserve common fairness.
M	That included, he said, TPS, or temporary protected status. Haitians have been seeking TPS for years. It allows people to live temporarily in the U.S. when their own countries have become unsafe because of political upheaval or natural disaster.
M	Many thought the catastrophe in Haiti would make it more likely for Haitians to gain TPS. But local leaders, like Marleine Bastien of the Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition, became infuriated today when the Obama administration stopped deportations of undocumented Haitians but made no mention of TPS.
M	The earthquake is just the latest disaster to befall the country. In 2008, four hurricanes struck Haiti. Community activist Lucie Tondreau says Haiti recovered from the storms. But just barely.

4	In pictures: Rescuers continue search Mass amputation fears How to manage a crisis US opens doors to Haiti orphans Battle against the looters Some buildings already weakened by last week's quake collapsed and wails of terror filled the air as frightened survivors poured out of unstable buildings, a BBC correspondent in the region said. Although some aid has started to reach desperate survivors, hundreds of thousands are still without food or water, a full week after the disaster.
7	Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) said its cargo plane with 12 tonnes of medical supplies had been turned away from the congested Port-au-Prince airport three times since Sunday. It said five patients died from lack of the supplies it carried. "We were forced to buy a saw in the market to continue amputations," the group's Loris de Filippi told the Reuters news agency in Cite Soleil.
4	But the US military has defended its efforts in the face of vast logistical challenges. "We're doing everything in our power to speed aid to Haiti as fast as humanly possible," said Gen Douglas Fraser, head of US Southern Command. He said they plan to start using two other airports, at Jacmel in Haiti and San Isidro in the neighbouring Dominican Republic, in the coming days.
0	Amazing rescues One full week after the magnitude seven quake devastated the country, search-and-rescue teams were emerging from the ruins with unbelievable success stories. Ena Zizi, 69, was rescued from the wreckage of the residence of Haiti's Roman Catholic archbishop on Monday, a day before crews recovered the body of the archbishop himself, Monsignor Joseph Serge Miot.
0	Another survivor, 25-year-old Lozama Hotteline, was rescued from beneath a collapsed supermarket with the help of teams from Turkey and France. Television pictures showed her smiling and singing as she was carried to safety. The United Nations said early on Wednesday that 121 people had been rescued by international teams since the 12 January earthquake - an extra 31 people on Tuesday.
4	Aid challenges In a bid to speed up the delivery of aid and stem looting and violence, US troops have stepped up their presence in the quake-ravaged country. AT THE SCENE Mark Doyle, BBC News, Port-au-Prince Haiti was extremely poor even before the earthquake, and this disaster has now broken all the basic services, like phones and electricity. But Haitians are resilient. Everywhere there are volunteers filling some of the gaps created by the slow arrival of international aid. A company which sells drinking water is distributing it free to people living in a school compound.
4	A Haitian Jesuit priest has mobilised local relief workers and international doctors to work together in a rural region just outside the capital. In a slum area, a volunteer first-aider dressed the wounds of a girl who had been trapped in rubble. These largely unsung heroes know they can't replace the big foreign aid agencies, but they're doing what they can to fill the gaps.
4	US Black Hawk helicopters swooped down on the grounds of Haiti's wrecked presidential palace on Tuesday, dropping scores of US troops who moved to secure a nearby hospital and set up aid distribution points. US Army Maj Gen Daniel Allyn, the deputy commander for relief operations in Haiti, said the military had delivered 400,000 bottles of water and 300,000 food rations since last Tuesday's earthquake. He said the number of US troops would grow to 10,000 in the coming weeks.
4	Meanwhile, the UN Security Council voted to temporarily boost its peacekeeping forces by 3,500 personnel. UN officials said they would accompany US troops as they delivered supplies. While military escorts are still needed to deliver relief supplies, the United Nations said fears of violence and looting had eased.
M	Improved security "The overall security situation in Port-au-Prince remains stable, with limited, localised violence and looting occurring," the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. So far, feared infectious diseases have not shown up, although many injured faced the immediate threats of tetanus and gangrene, and hospitals are overwhelmed. The UN says "localised looting" is occurring, but overall security is good
4	The Pentagon said a navy hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, had received its first Haitian patients, even as it was still heading towards Haiti. US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said the military is sending additional ships to help with earthquake recovery in Haiti, including one that could remove debris blocking the main port.
0	The World Food Programme said it was planning to bring in 10,000 gallons (40,000 litres) of diesel a day from the neighbouring Dominican Republic as Haitian fuel supplies dried up. Haitian officials say the death toll from the quake was likely to be between 100,000 and 200,000, and that 75,000 bodies had already been buried in mass graves.

4	The U.S. military said on Sunday it was doing its best to get as many planes as possible into Port-au-Prince, after NGOs complained shipments of aid had not been allowed to land at the U.S.-controlled airport. More than 30 countries have rushed relief to Haiti since Tuesday’s devastating earthquake, choking the airspace and the ramp at the small airfield and delaying the arrival of urgently needed medical and food supplies. Colonel Buck Elton, commander of the U.S. military directing flights at Haiti’s airport, said there had been 600 take-offs and landings since he took over the one-runway airport’s traffic on Wednesday, though 50 flights had been diverted. The airport’s control tower was knocked out by the quake and U.S. military air controllers were operating from a radio post on the airfield grass, he said. “What we set up here would be similar to running a major airport ... without any communications, electricity or computers,” Elton told reporters in a telephone briefing from Port-au-Prince. Medecins Sans Frontieres complained that a cargo plane carrying an inflatable surgical hospital was blocked from landing in Port-au-Prince on Saturday, and was rerouted to Samana, in the Dominican Republic, from where it would take 24 hours to get to the Haitian capital by truck. “Priority must be given immediately to planes carrying lifesaving equipment and medical personnel,” MSF (Doctors Without Borders) said in a statement. Elton said the flow of air traffic was improving, with only 3 of 67 incoming flights being rerouted on Saturday, and only two flights diverted on Sunday. The airport apron can only handle one wide-bodied plane and five narrow-bodied planes at a time, plus other aircraft that can be parked on the grass. “Our intent is as soon as one aircraft departs, another one arrives,” Elton said.

M	Amid sporadic looting and pleas from local police for backup, the U.S. military said Monday that the bottleneck slowing aid distribution in Haiti's capital is easing, with more flights moving through the city's airport and the seaport expected to reopen later this week.
M	In addition, the U.S. military on Monday staged the first drop of supplies from a fixed aircraft. Flying nonstop from a base in North Carolina, a C-17 delivered 14,500 meals ready to eat and 15,000 liters of water to a drop zone five miles northeast of the Port-au-Prince airport, the military said. Helicopters have been delivering supplies but their loads are significantly smaller.
M	Thirty three are now in the field, and will be joined by 15 more by Tuesday, the U.S. military said. U.S. officials also agreed with U.N. officials on a system to grant priority to humanitarian flights — following criticism that military and rescue flights had sometimes been first in line. Some countries and aid groups such as Geneva-based Doctors Without Borders had complained that planes filled with doctors and medical supplies had been forced to land in the neighboring Dominican Republic and come in by road, delaying urgent care for injured quake victims by two days.
M	In Paris, French Cooperation Minister Alain Joyandet expressed concern about the major U.S. military role in the country, saying it should be clarified: "This is about helping Haiti, not about occupying Haiti," said Joyandet, who last week complained about U.S. handling of the airport. But other French officials were conciliatory.
M	He said it's still more important to repair the damaged seaport — a task U.S. officials said they hoped to achieve this week. "In terms of aid, it's the port where we can bring most of the aid," Araud said.
M	The U.S. Coast Guard ship Oak is at the harbor and will use heavy cranes and other equipment to make the port functional. Also Monday, some 2,200 U.S. Marines arrived by ship, their mission to protect the huge relief operation.
7	Police: Haiti needs helpIt was not clear when the Marines would leave their ships for the destroyed streets of Port-au-Prince, but local police pleaded for backup immediately. "We do not have the capacity to fix this situation.
7	Haiti needs help ... the Americans are welcome here. But where are they? We need them here on the street with us," said policeman Dorsainvil Robenson, as he chased looters.
7	"Whether things explode is all down to whether help gets through from the international community," added police commander Ralph Jean-Brice, who runs Haiti's West Department. His police force is down by half due to the quake.
6	Looting spread to more parts of downtown Port-au-Prince on Monday as hundreds of young men and boys clambered up broken walls to break into shops to take whatever they could find. Especially prized was toothpaste, which people smear under their noses to fend off the stench of decaying bodies. At one place, youths fought over a stock of rum with broken bottles, machetes and razors and police fired shots into the air to break up the crowd.
6	"I am drinking as much as I can. It gives courage," said Jean-Pierre Junior, wielding a broken wooden plank with nails to protect his bottle of rum.
4	The Marines are arriving with heavy earth-moving equipment, medical aid and helicopters, said the U.S. Southern Command, which aims to have more than 10,000 U.S. troops in the area for the rescue operation. Some 1,000 U.S. troops were already on the ground Monday morning, most of them Army soldiers from the 82nd Airborne.
4	At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Monday asked the Security Council to beef up the U.N. peacekeeping force in Haiti with 1,500 additional police and 2,000 troops. The U.N. now has about 7,000 troops and 2,100 police in Haiti. A decision was expected Tuesday.
4	World leaders have promised massive amounts of assistance to rebuild Haiti since Tuesday's quake killed as many as 200,000 people and left its capital, Port-au-Prince, in ruins. European Union institutions and member states have offered more than $575 million in emergency and longer-term assistance to Haiti, which even before the disaster was already the poorest state in the Western Hemisphere.
7	Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, the U.N. special envoy to Haiti, arrived Monday in Port-au-Price, bringing aid supplies and being briefed on Haiti's needs. He was due to meet with Haitian President Rene Preval, whose cabinet met outside police headquarters on Sunday in a circle of white plastic chairs due to the collapse of the presidential palace. Streets piled with debris slowed the delivery of medical and food supplies, but there were signs of progress as international medical teams took over damaged hospitals where seriously injured people had lain untreated for days.
6	A few signs of normality returned as street sellers emerged with fruit and vegetables, but gangs of looters still prowled demolished streets of downtown Port-au-Prince. In downtown on Sunday, Haitian riot police fired tear gas to disperse looters as several nearby shops burned.
6	With people turning more desperate by the day, looters are even fighting each other with knives, hammers, ice picks and rocks. In some cases, neighbors have become vigilantes.
6	At least two suspected looters were shot dead on Sunday, witnesses said. Moreover, heavily armed gang members have returned to the Cite Soleil shantytown since breaking out from prison after the quake.
M	American officials are concerned about security in earthquake-stricken Haiti but consider the situation manageable, the U.S. ambassador to Haiti said in an interview. "The security situation is obviously not perfect," Kenneth Merten told TODAY when asked about the potential for violence among people desperate for food, water and shelter. Merten called the U.S. military presence in and around the island a backup option in the event of violence, saying first call would be the Haitian police force and the U.N. force in Haiti. He credited Brazilians in that force with making a strong contribution toward stability.

4	Canada's DART forces will focus efforts on the port town of Jacmel. Canada's disaster response team in Haiti will focus its aid efforts for the earthquake-ravaged Caribbean country on the port town of Jacmel, Brig.-Gen. Guy Laroche says.
4	Laroche, speaking from Port-au-Prince alongside Canada's ambassador to Haiti, Gilles Rivard, said the Disaster Assistance Response Team has been asked by the Haitian government to focus on the town that lies about 30 kilometres southwest of the capital of Port-au-Prince. How to help To help those affected by the earthquake, here is a list of organizations accepting donations.
7	Laroche said he travelled with Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive to see the damage in the town of 40,000 — a popular tourist destination — and saw that the hospital was half destroyed by the quake. The road into Jacmel has been cut off from the rest of the country since last Tuesday's quake, making delivery of aid difficult.
4	Canadian ships HMCS Athabaskan and HMCS Halifax, loaded with relief supplies, were just north of Haiti early Monday. Laroche said that while Athabaskan will move to west of Port-au-Prince, Halifax is bound for Jacmel.
7	Defence Minister Peter MacKay had earlier said the region faces other logistical challenges. The airport, little more than a runway, is capable of landing a Hercules aircraft but not the larger CC-177 transports, he said. The town's port, while not unusable, is still not equipped to handle a ship the size of the two Canadian vessels arriving Monday, meaning supplies and personnel would have to be ferried from the ships to the port, he said.
M	Jacmel is also the hometown of the father of Gov. Gen. Michaëlle Jean. As Canadian forces arrive in Haiti to provide more aid, Rivard said the process to get Canadians and their families out of the country has been complicated by crowds forming outside the embassy. On Saturday, Immigration Canada said it will expedite immigration applications from Haitians with family in this country, while Haitians in Canada temporarily will also be allowed to extend their stay.
M	But Rivard said erroneous Haitian media reports circulated that said any Haitian citizen could obtain a visa to Canada by showing up at the embassy. That led to aggressive crowds forming outside the embassy on Sunday, and has slowed the process of determining immigration claims. "I would say 90 per cent of the people that are here are here based on that rumour and not because they have a status of permanent resident or are close to getting that status of permanent resident," he said.

4	Anthony Thomas The team found large areas of Leogane had been reduced to a landscape of rubble and twisted metal. Before the quake, more than 100,000 people lived there.
5	"We were obviously the first team in there," Mr Thomas said. "Our job is to try and get people out from under the smashed buildings, but there was nobody to rescue. "There were dead bodies piled up by the roads. The people left are absolutely desperate for medical help."
7	Mr Thomas is working in a team of nine attached to the UK Fire Service. He said: "This is my fifth mission to a disaster zone and, as tragic as it is, you do get used to the death." He said the chances of finding anyone else alive in the rubble were dwindling as time passed.
M	The leading US general in Haiti Lt Gen Ken Keen has said it is a "reasonable assumption" that up to 200,000 people could have died in last week's earthquake. He said the disaster was of "epic proportions", but it was too early to know the full human cost.

4	An estimated 1.5 million people were left homeless by the 7.0-magnitude quake, which some have estimated has killed as many as 200,000 people. The UN says 130,000 people have now been relocated out of Port-au-Prince, easing the pressure on overcrowded camps in the city. Meanwhile the UN agency the World Food Programme says it has increased its food aid to survivors.
M	Speaking after a two-day evaluation mission to Port-au-Prince, the executive director of WFP, Josette Sheeran, said that on Friday the agency had delivered about 2 million meals. "This is the most complex operation WFP has ever launched," she said. "Haiti's entire supply chain infrastructure has been devastated, and we have been faced with launching an operation from scratch." A benefit concert featuring more than 100 music and Hollywood stars has been broadcast around the world to raise money for the victims of the earthquake.

4	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Ten American missionaries were charged Thursday in quake-hit Haiti with child abduction and criminal conspiracy, but should not be sent for trial in the United States, officials said. The group of five men and five women from an Idaho-based charity were detained on Friday after trying to drive a bus-load of 33 children over the border into the Dominican Republic.
4	They were formally charged with “kidnapping minors and criminal association” on Thursday according to their lawyer Edwin Coq. The group could now face nine years in prison on child kidnapping charges and further jail time for conspiracy. The group has denied any ill intentions, saying they were merely trying to help children orphaned and abandoned by the January 12 quake.
X	But amid continued chaos in the Haitian capital, the head of Port-au-Prince lawyers’ association, Gervais Charles, said any trial would be impossible in the country any time soon. “It is absolutely impossible to carry out the trial for the Americans in Haiti right now.
X	Judicial proceedings have not officially restarted in Port-au-Prince,” he said. Earlier government prosecutor Mazan Fortil said it was not yet clear if the 10 could be tried in the Haiti.
X	“We cannot say right now. We have to apply Haitian law. The case will be sent before a judicial panel, to open the investigation,” he said.
7	But with tens of thousands of children still homeless on the streets of Port-au-Prince, the government is under pressure to clamp down on potential abuse. The UN Children’s fund has warned that displaced children are in “significant” danger of being sold into slave-like conditions, trafficked or illegally adopted.
6	UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Hilde Frafjord Johnson also said the 7.0-magnitude quake had presented the agency with its biggest challenge. “The risks of child trafficking, children being sold to slavery-like conditions or illegally adopted… are significant,” she said. “As for the number of unaccompanied children, as the situation is unfolding this is the biggest… child protection crisis we’ve seen,” she added. About 40 percent of children were already living in great poverty and some 300,000 were living in orphanages before last month’s quake crippled life in the capital Port-au-Prince and surrounding area, UNICEF said.

4	The earthquake that killed up to 200,000 Haitians and left millions homeless also had a devastating toll on the country's economy -- eliminating as many as one in five jobs, the trade minister said on Monday. "We have maybe lost 20 percent," Trade and Industry Minister Josseline Colimon Fethiere said in an interview. Haiti struggled with unemployment even before the disaster, with two out of three of its 9 million people without formal work and 70 percent of them living on less than $2 a day. The quake came at a particularly bitter time for the hemisphere's poorest country because it had been enjoying a relative revival. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.N. special envoy to Haiti, declared at an investor conference last fall that the country was more stable than it had been in his lifetime.
7	On the afternoon of Jan. 12, Fethiere was at her desk in Port-au-Prince giving an interview to a newspaper from the Dominican Republic about recent improvements in the Haitian economy. "I was telling them that since last year we had created 28,000 jobs, and had some new foreign investment, almost $100 million," she said. As foreign donors met in Montreal to map out a rebuilding plan for the small Caribbean nation, Fethiere described how Haitian ministers were balancing their own losses - their offices were destroyed and many lost close relatives and homes - with the overwhelming needs of the population. She said she believed the country would do so, but that it would difficult.
M	And Fethiere, who took office only two months ago with the other members of Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive's government, insisted the country had put behind it the long years of corruption that had frustrated many international donors and angered the public. Haiti suffered political instability for more than 200 years since a slave revolt threw off French rule and created the world's first black republic. Steps toward democracy began when the Duvalier dictatorship ended in 1986, and the last military junta was thrown off in 1994. Transparency International's perceived global corruption index rates Haiti as one of the five most corrupt countries. "After so big a catastrophe, that the money would not go where it needs to go would be impossible," she said.

4	He added: "Haiti needs the massive support of its partners in the international community in the medium and long term. The extent of the task requires that we do more, that we do better and, without a doubt, that we work differently."
4	Canadian Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon welcomed the US offer to host an international donors' conference in March. "We now have the beginnings of a road map toward Haiti's long-term reconstruction and a clear and sustained commitment to follow through," Mr Cannon was quoted as saying by French news agency AFP. Mr Cannon said one goal was to "physically get the Haitian government back on its feet". The quake destroyed key government buildings, including the National Palace.
M	'Vanity parade' UK-based charity Oxfam has urged the international community to get Haiti's foreign debts cancelled. It said about $900m (£557m) owed to donor countries and institutions should be written off.
M	Many operations are still taking place in makeshift outdoor theatres The World Bank has already announced that it is waiving Haiti's debt payments for the next five years. And the Paris Club of creditor governments - including the US, UK, France and Germany - has called on other nations to follow its lead in cancelling debts to Haiti. Venezuela and Taiwan are the other biggest creditors.
M	Although aid continues to flow into Haiti, the head of Italy's civil protection service has strongly criticised the relief effort and the role of thousands of US troops sent there. Guido Bertolaso described the international aid operation as "a terrible situation that could have been managed much better". "When there is an emergency, it triggers a vanity parade.
M	Lots of people go there anxious to show that their country is big and important, showing solidarity," he said on Sunday. Mr Bertolaso, an Italian government minister, said it was "commendable" for the US to lead relief efforts, but "too many officers" meant they had not been able to find a capable leader.
M	Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement Aid workers have also criticised Haitian government plans to relocate hundreds of thousands of people from the capital, Port-au-Prince, to large camps outside the city.
1	Caroline Gluck, from Oxfam, told the BBC the move could be dangerous for the survivors. "In the past, experience has told us establishing some huge camps can cause all kinds of security problems, for example, robberies, rapes and kind of gang activities if the camps are kept too big," she said. Oxfam was pressing for the camps to be smaller, she added.

4	Barack Obama today announced a large US relief effort for Haiti, where between 45,000 and 50,000 people are feared dead after a devastating earthquake.
4	The US president said America would give $100m to the aid effort for the stricken Caribbean country and pledged that the people of Haiti "will not be forgotten". Obama said he had told US agency and department heads to put Haiti at the top of their agenda. "This is one of those moments that cries out for American leadership," Obama, flanked by his most senior officials, told reporters.
4	Obama's impassioned remarks came as international rescue teams today began arriving in Haiti, where the death toll from Tuesday's earthquake has been put at between 45,000 and 50,000 by the Haitian Red Cross, the first estimate released by a relief organisation. Aid aircraft from China, France, the US and Spain flew into Port-au-Prince, while a British specialist rescue team that arrived overnight in the neighbouring Dominican Republic also arrived in the Haitian capital.
4	Gordon Brown described the earthquake as a "tragedy beyond imagination" and urged the British public to support emergency appeals. "The past 24 hours have been truly horrific for the people of Haiti. It is a catastrophe that is still unravelling," he told a news conference.
4	He said many people were still buried in the rubble and in need of urgent rescue. The British government announced a £6.15m donation "to help kickstart humanitarian relief in Haiti".
4	"The most pressing need is for international search and rescue teams, including firefighters from all over Britain, to get on with their work of saving lives," Douglas Alexander, the international development secretary, said. The Lincolnshire chief fire officer, Mike Thomas, leading the British rescue team – many of whom were recently involved in a similar rescue operation in Sumatra – said it would immediately begin liaising with agencies on the ground. "Our first priority is to assess the needs and start to identify areas where people are still trapped," he told the BBC.
4	The party includes 71 rescue specialists, dogs, heavy equipment and a four-man team from the British government. A US aircraft carrier, the Carl Vinson, was expected to arrive off the coast today, and the US navy said the amphibious assault ship Bataan, with a 2,000-strong Marine unit, has been ordered to sail as soon as possible.
4	Another 3,500 US soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division are also heading to the country to assist with disaster relief and security, amid fears that law and order could collapse. Three hundred US medics were also being sent. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, pledged long-term help for the crippled government.
2	Parliament, the national palace, and many government buildings collapsed and it was unclear how many politicians and officials survived. The main prison also fell, allowing criminals to escape.
4	"The authorities that existed before the earthquake are not able to fully function. We're going to try to support them as they re-establish authority," Clinton told CNN.
4	Hundreds of Cuban doctors already in Haiti helped treat the injured in field hospitals. The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said three planes touched down to evacuate around 60 injured people to hospitals on the Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe. He told France Inter radio that two additional French relief planes were also on their way.
5	Journalists in Port-au-Prince said the devastated city's emergency services had been completely overwhelmed by the magnitude 7.0 earthquake, the largest to strike Haiti in two centuries. "This is a particularly grim sight," Matthew Price, a BBC correspondent speaking from a hospital in the capital, said.
5	Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said head wounds, crushing injuries and severe trauma were the most common cases needing treatment. Field treatment centres have been set up outside hospitals, while a refugee camp has been established near the airport.
4	Amid the gloom, there were moments of celebration when survivors were pulled alive from the rubble. Among those rescued was Danielle Trépanier, a Canadian logistics co-ordinator with MSF, who spent almost 24 hours trapped in the debris of a staff house.
4	The International Committee of the Red Cross set up a website to help survivors locate relatives and friends. About 1,360 Haitians, mostly in the US and Canada, registered on the site within hours of it going live.
M	The earthquake is the latest disaster to hit Haiti, which has suffered a succession of hurricanes in recent years. The International Red Cross estimated that three million people – one-third of the population – could need emergency relief, while the Haitian president, René Préval, said the damage was "un­imaginable". The prime minister, Jean-Max Bellerive, told CNN the final death toll could be well over 100,000, while Youri Latortue, a senator, told the Associated Press that 500,000 may be dead.
7	Both admitted that they had no way of knowing. The American Red Cross said the aid organisation had already run out of medical supplies, with spokesman Eric Porterfield explaining that the small amount of medical equipment and medical supplies available in Haiti had been distributed.
4	The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), a coalition of 13 relief agencies, is taking donations on a special phone line, 0370 60 60 900, and through its website. It is expected to launch a television appeal tomorrow. A spokesman said giving money was the best way for people to help, enabling supplies to be bought as close to the disaster area as possible and sent straight to those in need.
4	Save the Children said 2 million children could have been affected. Jasmin Whitbread, the chief executive, said children were particularly vulnerable in the disaster.

0	On January 12, 2010 a powerful earthquake 7.3 on Richter scale - struck Haiti near its capital Port-au-Prince.
5	The earthquake caused catastrophic destruction throughout the city of 2 million inhabitants, capital of the poorest country in the northern hemisphere. In addition to countless deaths, the humanitarian disaster affected 3 million people.
4	The Canadian aid agencies of the Humanitarian Coalition have been present in Haiti for more than five decades and had more than 600 staff working in the country when the earthquake hit on January 12th, 2010. They, and other Canadian and international aid agencies, immediately responded to meet the urgent needs of survivors of the quake.
4	The Humanitarian Coalition and its members fundraised over $15.5 million for humanitarian response programs for disaster survivors. Since the earthquake, the members of the Humanitarian Coalition have effectively contributed to rebuilding Haiti alongside the survivors of the earthquake. The members of the Humanitarian Coalition have reached hundreds of thousands of Haitians through its donor program with essential and urgently needed assistance, while also supporting recovery and reconstruction efforts.

4	The federal government has so far allocated $113 million to match individual donations made by Canadians to the Haiti relief effort, International Co-operation Minister Bev Oda said Monday. "This amazing response reflects the true values of Canadians," she said.
4	The deadline for having personal donations matched by the federal government is Feb. 12. Oda said the matching funds will not come from other programs at the Canadian International Development Agency.
4	She said the agency has a pool of funds that can be used in times of disaster. The Jan. 12 earthquake that struck impoverished Haiti killed an estimated 200,000 people, and left millions in desperate need of food, shelter and medical aid. The federal International Co-operation Department said that Canada, through CIDA, has already provided about $85 million in humanitarian aid through UN agencies, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and to Canadian organizations such as CARE, Médecins du Monde, Save the Children, Oxfam Quebec, the Centre for International Studies and Co-operation, and World Vision.
M	Oda said that Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has distributed more than 17,500 tents, shelters or tarps, 2,000 mosquito nets, nearly 5,000 hygiene kits or kitchen sets, 3,000 blankets and almost 10,000 buckets or jerry cans. She said they are all maintained for CIDA by the Red Cross.

4	The federal government has lifted the limit on the amount of money allocated for matching individual donations to Haitian earthquake relief, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced Saturday.
4	The government had set aside $50 million in its dollar-for-dollar fund, but Harper said due to Canadians' "overwhelming generosity," the decision was made to remove the cap. "My latest figures are that more than $67 million has been donated to eligible aid organizations, with $45 million to the Canadian Red Cross alone, in order to alleviate the suffering in the earthquake-ravaged country," Harper said.
5	At the same Ottawa briefing, Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon announced that 17 Canadians have been confirmed among the dead in Haiti. That number rose to 18 later in the day.
5	Searchers looking through the rubble of the Hotel Montana in Port-au-Prince found the body of former Liberal MP Serge Marcil, his wife, Christiane Pelchat, confirmed Saturday. How to help To help those affected by the earthquake, here is a list of organizations accepting donations. Marcil, 65, was working for an engineering firm and heading to the fifth floor of the hotel on the elevator when the quake struck, according to a colleague who was with him on the business trip.
7	"We offer our condolences to families and offer our prayers to friends and loved ones," Cannon said, adding that he expected the number of deaths involving Canadians to increase. The number of Canadians still unaccounted for in affected areas has dropped to 236, while the number of the missing who have been located now stands at 1,139, he said.
2	Members of the Canadian Forces have been working non-stop for the past two days, searching through the rubble of collapsed buildings in the capital, Port-au-Prince, he said. The team is focusing on the Hotel Montana and nearby sites.
2	The quake flattened the five-storey hotel, which once stood on a hill overlooking the city. The government has not said how many Canadians were staying at the Montana and Cannon did not say how the Montana site may have figured in the latest update of the number of dead.
4	"The days ahead will not be easy for Canadians who are without news of their loved ones," the minister said. The Foreign Affairs emergency operations centre has received some 31,000 calls about Haiti. Cannon said 1,891 Canadians have been returned to Canada on 21 military flights, in addition to 265 on three commercial flights, for a total of 2,156 brought home.
4	Defence Minister Peter MacKay said the components of a Canadian field hospital will be arriving in the city of Léogâne, to the south of the capital, in the next 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, a 16-member Canadian Forces medical team continues to treat the sick and injured at Sainte Michel Hospital in Léogâne.

4	The province and the Office of Emergency Management are working in close collaboration with the federal government, other provinces and territories, and international aid agencies to co-ordinate the Canadian humanitarian response to Haiti.
4	"Immediately following the massive earthquake that caused destruction in Port au Prince on Jan. 12, Nova Scotia offered assistance and resources to the Canadian relief effort," said Ramona Jennex, Minister responsible for Emergency Management. Already, Nova Scotia has contributed $100,000 to the relief effort. The Department of Health is working with districts to compile and inventory vailable medical supplies, should they be needed.
4	In addition, Nova Scotia is working with the federal government to bring Canadian citizens, who were in Haiti when the earthquake struck, home. To date, no Canadians in Haiti have indicated that they are returning to Nova Scotia.
4	However, EMO, the departments of Community Services and Health, as well as the Red Cross and the Canadian Military, have co-ordinated plans to appropriately respond to the needs of any returning Nova Scotians. Nova Scotia has also offered assistance to the Quebec government, as Montreal is the entry point for returning Canadians.
M	The federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade is leading the Canadian response in Haiti. Aid to Haiti must be co-ordinated with the international aid effort to ensure that resources can be transported into the country and that the aid offered assists, not impedes, the response. Conditions at the Port au Prince International Airport remain congested, increasing the need to carefully co-ordinate the transport of personnel and resource into Haiti.
4	Officials at the Emergency Management Office are in constant contact with the federal government, Public Safety Canada, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, the provinces and territories and the Red Cross. The Nova Scotia Joint Emergency Operations Centre is actively monitoring the situation and responding to any federal requests for assistance.
4	The Canadian government is matching donations to registered charities providing aid to Haiti up to a total of $50 million. For additional information on making a donation to a registered aid agency, please visit: www.canadainternational.gc.ca/haiti , click Earthquake in Haiti, then How Canadians Can Help.

M	Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach promised $500,000 for earthquake relief in Haiti, a day after indicating the province wouldn't be directly donating to an aid agency. Stelmach announced the donation to the Red Cross following a swearing-in ceremony for his new cabinet in Edmonton on Friday morning. Provinces, territories donating directly to relief efforts in Haiti Yukon: $25,000. British Columbia: $500,000. Alberta: $500,000. Manitoba: $100,000. Saskatchewan: $250,000. Ontario: $1 million. Nova Scotia: $100,000. New Brunswick: $100,000. Prince Edward Island: $50,000. Newfoundland and Labrador: $1 million.
M	On Thursday, when asked how Alberta planned to help in Haiti, Stelmach told reporters that Alberta contributes to humanitarian aid in other ways, through grants and charitable tax deductions. The province provides a tax credit of 10 per cent on the first $200 in eligible charitable donations made in a tax year and, through its Community Spirit Program, an additional 21 per cent on donations that exceed $200 and go to charities registered or incorporated in Alberta. "That is the best tax deduction in Canada, so those that want to contribute to humanitarian aid will see that tax credit," Stelmach said. At the time, Stelmach encouraged Albertans to open their wallets.
